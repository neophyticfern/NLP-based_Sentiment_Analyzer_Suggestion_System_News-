BABA,12/03/2018 10:05,India’s Former Central Bank Chief on How to Fix the Country’s Economy,https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-to-fix-india-economy-1543857482,"Within emerging markets, India is seen as less vulnerable to the trade skirmishes playing out between the U.S. and China. That’s a positive, but the country is facing another set of challenges, from a deepening credit crunch and persistent bad debts at its public-sector banks, to a sizable fiscal deficit and an economy not growing as fast as it can.In our recent conversation with Raghuram Rajan, the former head of India’s central bank put some of India’s challenges in perspective—and offered ways to address them. Here are some more highlights of that discussion on India.India’s deficit put it in the “Fragile Five” group of countries deemed financially vulnerable back in 2013. Rajan helped get the country on a better course, in part by tackling inflation. The rupee weakened against the dollar to an all-time low this fall, and there are renewed jitters about India’s fiscal deficit.Rajan said some of the decline in the currency was natural as the rupee adjusted to the lower inflation rate. As for the deficit, Rajan says that India’s fiscal deficit has stayed around 7% of GDP, in part because an increase at the state level has offset reductions elsewhere. The country’s economic growth has kept a lid on the debt level, though Rajan says that is not something the country can rely on forever.India’s economic growth slowed to 7.1% in the second quarter—still among the fastest in the world but not fast enough. Rajan thinks the economy needs to grow at a pace of 9% to 10%, considering India needs to create one new million jobs a month. The easiest way to do that is to make it easier to build in India and increase the role of the construction industry through structural reforms, like making land acquisition easier—something that the federal government has grappled with for a while.“The reality is a number of states have figured out the secret sauce and the government needs to examine the experience and make it universal,” Rajan says. For example, the state of Uttar Pradesh came up with ways where it bought land from farmers by promising them some of it back after development.“The government getting involved in land acquisition is the third rail of Indian politics,” Rajan says. “As soon as the government pushes it in a big way, there are accusations it is favoring one group over the other. You have to find ways to assuage concerns and make it more transparent but also make sure India gets roads, highways and ports we absolutely need.”While at the Reserve Bank of India, Rajan tried to address the bad debt at the country’s public sector banks. But banks are still struggling with the issue. Part of the issue is that India didn’t have a bankruptcy court for years.For years, India and technology were synonymous. But there’s less talk about India in the new frontiers of technology, like robotics and artificial intelligence, which concerns Rajan. “There are start-ups that you may not have heard of but which are doing some interesting things, including [artificial intelligence],” Rajan says. “But they are at much smaller levels at this point than  Baidu,Alibaba, and  Tencent. The traditional IT giants will have to work very hard to have a presence in some of these frontier industries. Thus far, it seems to me it’s been slow.”India’s stocks have fallen sharply this year, and the  iShares MSCI India  ETF (INDA) is down about 8% this year. But in a note to clients last week, Gavekal Research strategists said they don’t see much potential for a bounce back more so than in other emerging markets. Despite the sell-off, Gavekal analysts noted that Indian equities are still trading at a 50% premium over emerging market peers—a large gap even if the economy is among the world’s fastest-growing.Write to Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.com"
BABA,12/03/2018 02:05,China’s Beaten-Down Tech Stocks Could Be a Buy Now,https://www.barrons.com/articles/china-tech-stocks-to-buy-1543777795,"Chinese tech stocks have tumbled this year, dragging down China’s market and emerging equities more broadly. Those lower prices and a better outlook for 2019 could make this a good time to get into the shares, according to BlackRock’s chief equity strategist, Kate Moore.China’s tech sector has been hammered by worries about trade friction with the U.S. Regulatory changes in China also “imposed a drag on revenue for tech and media companies, many of which had grown unfettered and unregulated,” Moore writes in a blog.Chinese tech earnings surged by 56% in 2017. Yet profit estimates fell throughout 2018, with stock prices following, Moore notes.China’s tech sector is becoming a critical driver of China’s economic growth, supported by plenty of capital and favorable long-term policy from Beijing. “The Chinese are embracing technology to offset rising labor costs and the pressures of aging populations,” Moore writes. China aims to be more self-sufficient technologically, building its own semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and components, for instance, rather than importing as many goods.Read more: Trump and China Called a Truce in the Trade War. Now What?The upshot? The earnings outlook looks brighter for 2019, Moore writes, making this a good time for investors “to dip their toes into Chinese tech at more attractive levels.”Investors can get exposure to the sector through an exchange-traded fund. The iShares MSCI China ETF (ticker: MCHI) holds 36% of its assets in tech, almost entirely in three stocks: Alibaba Group (BABA), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and China Mobile (CHL).For more targeted exposure, the Invesco China Technology ETF (CQQQ) holds 74 stocks, including dozens of small and midsize companies involved in everything from mobile technology to e-commerce, gaming and semiconductor manufacturing. That makes for a more diversified mix, including many companies that don’t trade with American Depository Receipts, like Sunny Optical Technology Group (Hong Kong.2382) and NetDragon Websoft Holdings (Hong Kong.777).Stocks in the Invesco ETF have an average market capitalization of $14.4 billion and trade at a forward price/earnings ratio of 15. That doesn’t look expensive if Chinese companies can keep growing earnings in line with their long-term average of 21%, according to Morningstar.One consideration: Both ETFs are at the mercy of the trade war between the U.S. and China. Tech is at the heart of the dispute. China aims to develop a home-grown tech industry and maintain access to U.S. markets, while the U.S. is pressuring Beijing to stop the alleged theft of intellectual property and production of counterfeit goods in Chinese factories.Investors should hang on for a volatile ride. After surging 74% in 2017, the Invesco ETF is down 27% this year. Yes, Chinese tech stocks may look cheap. But they could get cheaper if the trade war worsens before getting better.Write to Daren Fonda at daren.fonda@barrons.com"
BABA,11/30/18,"Chinese biotech stocks hit by a double whammy, which means it’s time to buy",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-biotech-stocks-hit-by-a-double-whammy-which-means-its-time-to-buy-2018-11-30,"Have investors hit peak negativity on China-based companies? I think there’s a good chance they have. If so, it’s time to buy China stocks, especially in biotechnology.Chinese biotech stocks have been particularly hammered because they are getting hit by a double whammy. They’re down because investors are overly negative on China due to trade-war tensions. And unlike the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.09% the U.S. biotech sector is actually already in a bear market. The SPDR S&P Biotech exchange traded fund XBI, +3.65% was recently down 25% from its summer highs.I’ll tell you the best way to buy China biotech stocks — and it is surprisingly easy. But first let’s look at why the worries behind the selloff in China stocks and biotech in general are overblown.On China fears, it’s key to keep in mind that President Donald Trump’s negotiating style is to start with bluster (which spooks investors) and then dial back to compromise to be able to boast about a “deal.”That’s going to be the case with China trade. One reason is that, near term, neither country can stand — or deserves — the pain that comes from a harsh trade regime.U.S. companies have extensive supply chains winding through China, which will be hard and costly to replace. U.S. consumers enjoy the cheap, yet high-quality, goods that come out of China — everything from guitars to Apple AAPL, +3.49%  iPhones. China needs U.S. markets and access to U.S. business partnerships, and university slots for students.So we’re going to see signs of progress on China trade talks and probably soon — at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Nov. 30 through Dec. 1.“The majority of clients believe there will be a truce, meaning there will be an agreement to resume negotiations and there will be no increase in tariffs over that period,” says John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy at J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.94%Even if we don’t get any signs of progress on China trade tensions, it never made sense that China biotech stocks should get hit by this war on trade. After all, who would hold human lives hostage to politics?On the biotech weakness, the key thing to remember here is that the selloff has little to do with sector trends, says Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee. It’s more about investors fleeing a high-beta group in a risk-off environment. When investor confidence returns, which is likely because there’s no looming recession and because the Fed will probably soon signal it’s reducing the number of planned rate hikes, high-beta groups like biotech will be among the best performers. China biotech stocks look like a great way to position for this kind of move, given the double whammy at work.But how to get access? Here you’re in luck. For the past few years biotech expert Brad Loncar has been travelling to China to meet with biotech companies and study which ones to put in a China biotech index he’s devised. Now there’s a an ETF based on that index. It’s called the Loncar China BioPharma ETF CHNA, +1.70%Loncar got a big break in this effort when Hong Kong recently loosened listing standards for companies, in that they’re no longer required to show revenue. This opened the door to listings of China biotech companies on the Hong Kong exchange. That’s a good thing for investors, because the Hong Kong exchange has fairly stringent listing standards. Mistakes will get through, but this generally means investors are less likely to buy into a fraud when they buy a Hong Kong-listed China biotech stock.The Loncar China BioPharma ETF gives you easy access to 28 biotech companies. Based on a small sampling of this group that I’ve studied and suggested in my stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks, these are quality companies with decent prospects. One of them is BeiGene BGNE, -1.64% which I first suggested in my letter at $28 in February 2016. It was up 685% by June 2018. And even in the biotech rout it is still up 400%. (My current buy limit is $100, give or take a little.) Another of mine in the Loncar ETF is the small-cap CASI Pharmaceuticals CASI, +5.31% This one advanced 270% after I suggested it in the low $2 range in early November 2017. I recently reiterated it because it looks attractive again in the pullback below $4.The Loncar China BioPharma ETF gives you access to plenty more potential China biotech winners like these, but it has one shortcoming, at least for now. Volume and liquidity are low, which means the bid-ask spread is wide. One way around this is to put in a limit buy order near the bid, and camp out until it gets hit.Besides an expected truce in the war on trade with China, which will soon put a bid under Chinese stocks again, here are four other reasons why it makes sense to invest in Chinese biotech for the long haul.1. The government really wants the sector to winUntil recently, China had no biotech or pharma sector speak of. Most pharma companies either developed generic drugs or manufactured drugs. “They didn’t do innovation or create new drugs, but that is changing dramatically overnight,” says Loncar. Biotech is a key part of the country’s efforts to spur continued growth by developing more sophisticated companies.2. The Hong Kong exchange now welcomes revenue-light businesses from China“That basically describes 99% of biotech companies,” Loncar, because they tend to be early-stage, developing businesses. The Hong Kong change is “huge” for China’s biotech sector, says Loncar, because it gives venture-capital firms an easier way to exit investments to realize gains, and put the money into start-ups. “That is super-important because it creates an ecosystem for investing in biotech for the first time,” says Loncar.3. China FDA upgradeChina has completely revamped its version of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to bring it up to global standards, says Loncar. This improves the quality of the sector, and piques investor interest.4. U.S.-trained talent is returning homeMajor China companies including Tencent TCEHY, +3.44% Baidu BIDU, +1.62% and Alibaba BABA, +1.79% exist, in part, because Chinese nationals who studied in the U.S. and worked at U.S. companies like Google GOOG, +1.10%GOOGL, +0.60% Facebook FB, +0.34% and Amazon.com AMZN, +4.86% returned to China to work in tech start-ups.“A lot of Chinese professionals who were educated in the U.S. and worked at U.S. biotech companies are going home now and starting biotech companies,” says Loncar.Those four factors add up to a “perfect storm” that should create a solid biotech sector in the country over the next several years. If so, now is the time to buy in.Keep in mind that even if these stocks get a boost near term on signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks, this group will be volatile because U.S.-China tensions will persist for decades as the two great powers battle for global hegemony.But there may be some good news in this, too. Persistent trade tensions could increase China’s focus on developing its biotech sector, as a way to move away from reliance on trade for growth, says Loncar. “They’re going to have world-class biotech sector, I have no doubt about that.”At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

Ives reaffirmed his $140 price target for the company’s shares.Companies are shifting huge sums of their technology spending to the cloud as it offers better reliability, an easier path to scaling up, and greater cost efficiencies versus using traditional on-premises computing equipment.According to Gartner, Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services was the leader in cloud computing with a 52% market share last year, followed by Microsoft at 13%, Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) at 5%, and Alphabet ’s (GOOGL) Google at 3%.The analyst noted that Microsoft’s Azure cloud business grew 76% in its most recent quarter. He estimated 30% of technology workloads are currently on the cloud, a share that he said will rise to 55% by 2022. Ives believes Microsoft’s cloud growth is in its early stages.“We believe the shift to cloud is a major secular trend that is significantly benefiting MSFT in the field as a key tailwind and should continue its momentum heading into FY2019,” he wrote.Microsoft has significantly outperformed the market this year.

GOOG,12/01/18,Utility stocks have beaten the S&P 500 in two months of turbulence and in the long run,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/utility-stocks-have-beaten-the-sp-500-in-two-months-of-turbulence-and-in-the-long-run-2018-11-28,"The S&P 500 utilities sector has been the best performer during the market decline that began in October. Don’t roll your eyes.We know it may not be a surprise, as utility companies offer investors a haven in times of turbulence. But what may interest you is how much better this stodgy sector’s performance has been over long periods.From the end of September, the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.09%  has declined 8%, including reinvested dividends, while the S&P 500 utilities sector returned a positive 3.3%. Here’s a chart showing how well the 12 sectors of the S&P 500 Index have fared over various periods:The S&P 500 utilities sector has been the best during the post-September market turmoil and has ranked second for 2018 through Nov. 26. But if you look at the longer periods, the total returns exceed those of the entire S&P 500 for all periods except for 10 years.But that 10-year figure is a bit deceptive. You need to consider what occurred before this 10-year period began. The S&P 500 was down 34% (including reinvested dividends) for two years through Nov. 26, 2008, while the utilities sector suffered a far milder 13% decline.The 20-year chart shows that, for the most part, the utilities sector has had less “downside capture” than the index:There’s no question that over the past five years, the information-technology sector, driven by the market-cap-weighted performance of the FAANG companies (Facebook FB, +0.34% Apple AAPL, +3.49% Amazon AMZN, +4.86% Netflix NFLX, +1.46%  and Alphabet GOOG, +1.10% ), has been the place to be. But the FAANG stocks have all fared even worse than the S&P 500 since the end of September, despite the companies’ fast growth.The 15-year and 20-year returns give evidence to the importance of the utilities sector: People and companies need those services in what is a critical industry protected by regulators. Utilities also reward investors with steady dividend payouts.Concentrating on individual stocks can be a risky endeavor. Shares of PG&E Corp. PCG, +2.77% the owner of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., are down 47% for 2018. Investors have worried that the company may be held liable for the California wildfires. Then again, some investors have looked at the decline as an opportunity.Regardless of how the PG&E saga plays out, there’s no question that a safer way for investors to gain exposure to the utilities sector is through an exchange traded fund, such as the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLU, +1.01%  the Vanguard Utilities ETF  VPU, +0.86%   or the iShares U.S. Utilities ETF  IDU, +0.95%Here are all 29 stocks included in the S&P 500 utilities sector, ranked by how well they have performed over the past five years:You can click on the tickers for more about each company, including news, profiles, charts, ratings and financials.Don’t miss: These stocks are in bear territory, but analysts expect them to roar backCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn’s Deep Dive columns here.Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

At a time when gurus’ calls are on both bullish and bearish sides, many investors found some clarity in “Here’s how to tell if stocks will enter a bear market or rise to new highs.”Important events are ahead.

This is positive.• The chart shows a very short-term bottoming pattern. This is positive.• The chart shows RSI (relative strength index) divergence. In plain English, this means that although the price fell below a prior low, RSI did not go as low. This is a mild positive.• As the chart shows, the overall pattern of RSI is positive.• The low came on somewhat heavier volume. This is mildly positive. However, this is a low conviction point; a significantly higher volume would have increased the probability of this being a bottom.• As the chart shows, the rally is on low volume. This is negative.• Positive earnings from Salesforce CRM, +0.97% and Nutanix NTNX, +0.56% are creating positive sentiment.• Smart-money flows in semiconductor stocks such as Applied Materials AMAT, +2.84% and Micron Technology MU, +3.81%  have turned to neutral from negative. Smart-money flows have been positive in Intel INTC, +1.66% through most of the tech decline; interestingly, Intel has held up well during this period. Smart-money flows turned positive in AMD AMD, +11.31% at the depth of the selloff. You already know from my writings over the years that smart-money flows have a great track record.

Three of the eight alleged perpetrators were arrested overseas on charges including wire fraud, computer intrusion and money laundering. The others remain at large.“The defendants in this case used sophisticated computer programming and infrastructure around the world to exploit the digital advertising industry through fraud,” said Richard Donoghue, the U.S. Attorney for the district.

GDPR, which took effect in May, strictly delineates how companies may collect or process information about EU residents.The consumer groups said the search-engine giant collects location data on users of its apps through features and “does not give them straightforward information about what this effectively entails,” according to a statement issued by the European Consumer Organization, an umbrella group for national bodies across the continent. The groups say the practice violates “fundamental GDPR principles.”Separately in London, parliament members from an international committee representing nine countries questioned — at times angrily — Richard Allan, Facebook Inc.’s FB, +0.34%   vice president of policy solutions, about how the social network shares personal data and how it has fought misinformation.

AMZN,12/03/2018 12:05,"It’s Time to Get Choosy About Retail Stocks, Analyst Says",https://www.barrons.com/articles/its-time-to-get-choosy-about-retail-stocks-analyst-says-1543866543,"Retail is off to a strong start this holiday season, but 2019 may not look so jolly.Where we were: Retail rallied for much of this year, and a strong Black Friday showing helped to alleviate some fears.Where we’re headed: It’s time to get selective among retail stocks as the backdrop becomes less accommodating, says Guggenheim.Before Thanksgiving, investors were worried that retailers wouldn’t be able to live up to expectations after a robust 2017 holiday shopping season. A strong Black Friday/Cyber Monday showing provided some relief, and then the sector got another boost from the trade truce, which at least removes the specter of a new round of tariffs for Jan. 1.While those factors may have put some skeptics at ease, Guggenheim’s John Heinbockel isn’t convinced. He argues that while retailers may be in a sweet spot now, the operating environment is basically as good as it can get, meaning that things are likely to get more challenging over the next year as demand drifts back toward more normal levels and cost pressures remain. That means it will be difficult for companies to keep improving margins and beating expectations for their earnings.It may seem odd to worry about retail at a time when consumer confidence is hovering around a nearly two-decade high, but Heinbockel writes that the robust readings from the last six months are simply too good to last. “This spending growth looks unsustainable,” he says.Not surprisingly consumer discretionary stocks have seen the biggest boost from consumer confidence. After all, it’s much more exciting to buy a new gadget or pair of shoes with the extra money in your pocket than it is to stock up on soap.Total discretionary spending has risen noticeably in the past two years, driven in large part by furniture, home furnishings, and information processing equipment. Yet that means these retailers could have more to lose. “In a moderating growth environment, discretionary would slow the most,” Heinbockel says.Then there’s the fact that e-commerce continues to grow relentlessly. While it’s no longer solely the domain of big players like Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN), traditional retailers that have a good online presence still often find that those sales come with slimmer margins, he writes. Freight costs are going up, as are wages, and while tariff relief is good, it’s only temporary.That’s not to say that Heinbockel suggests throwing in the towel, however. He writes that investors should stick with retailers that are “value-driven share gainers, in both discretionary and consumables channels, who should be able to deliver above-average, profitable growth in this environment.” Restoration Hardware parent RH (RH) and Performance Food Group (PFGC) are his favorite ideas, although he also likes At Home Group (HOME), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Floor Décor (FND), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO), and U.S. Food Holdings (USFD).Heinbockel isn’t alone in his concern that the Goldilocks environment for retail can’t last forever. The stocks may be able to resume their rally through the end of 2018 if the holiday shopping season remains strong, but in the new year, tariffs will likely regain prominence in investors’ minds. Aside from that, the next catalyst for the stocks will likely be fourth-quarter reports, when we will get a better look at whether organic demand or deep discounting drove sales, not to mention how margins did in an environment where free and fast shipping is becoming the norm.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) was up 1% to $46.80 this afternoon.Make the ConnectionDiscounters could be a safe haven as retail’s road gets harder.More thoughts on how long the retail party can last.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com"
AMZN,12/03/2018 09:05,Here’s what would have made Virginia walk away from an Amazon HQ2 deal,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-would-have-made-virginia-walk-away-from-an-amazon-hq2-deal-2018-11-30,"As the incentives for Amazon’s second headquarters attract attention, Virginia officials have been stressing they had limits on what they were willing to offer.The state’s team has promised about $800 million in direct incentives, including $550 million in cash grants if the e-commerce giant delivers on its promise of 25,000 new jobs over 12 years.“Had Amazon come back and said, ‘Well, no. We need that to be $1 billion to us, not $550 million,’ the state was very adamant that was not going to happen,” said Ryan Touhill, an Alexandria Economic Development Partnership official who was part of the Virginia team that worked with Amazon. “And we felt that was OK, if that was going to be the case. We could walk away from that deal.”His comments came during a panel discussion on Wednesday looking at government incentives in the wake of the competition among localities to attract Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN, +4.86% secondary headquarters. When asked to elaborate on a walk-away number, Touhill said Friday that his point was that “if it got into the billions, like other states were offering, I don’t think we were going to go down that road.” Virginia’s Major Employment and Investment Commission, which approves such grants, had approved $550 million, and it would have had to sign off on any higher figure, said Touhill, who is chief of staff at the economic-development agency.Other officials from Virginia have made similar points. That state commission’s chairman, Frank Ruff, told the Washington Business Journal that Virginia was “not going to get into the bidding war.” The Virginia Economic Development Partnership’s director, Stephen Moret, has talked up being “a relatively low-incentive state” and wanting to win “in a Virginia way” that was “more about emphasizing our assets.”But Touhill pushed back this week when asked about whether any incentives were needed at all to land Amazon’s HQ2, given Northern Virginia’s strengths. The region’s positives include unemployment rates of about 2% in Arlington County and the city of Alexandria. Some locations that were finalists were offering “enormous” incentive packages, and Virginia officials felt “a need to compete” and make “a very prudent offer,” he said at the panel discussion in Washington, D.C., which was sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts and George Washington University’s Center for Washington Area Studies.Read more: What cities that lost out on Amazon’s HQ2 need to doTouhill also rejected suggestions that Amazon — whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns a mansion in Washington, D.C., as well as the Washington Post — had planned all along to pick the D.C. area. The Seattle-based company announced on Nov. 13 that it plans to locate its so-called HQ2 in both Crystal City, Va., and Long Island City, N.Y., with about 25,000 employees in each place, following a long selection process. Crystal City is in Arlington County, but neighboring Alexandria is due to become home to a new $1 billion Virginia Tech facility that was part of the state’s pitch to Amazon.“I don’t agree with the assessment that they had already decided before they started this,” Touhill said. “We went through 14 months of work and review on this, and there were moments where we felt there was still very stiff competition, and that it was on us to try to win it.”Economic-development deals in general have changed in recent years, and Virginia’s $550 million for Amazon is a performance-based grant, he said. “None of that money is going out the door until jobs are created. It’s not like the commonwealth wrote a check for $550 million at the signing ceremony.”Don’t miss: What every American should know about a Foxconn in their backyardVirginia’s offer has been praised as relatively restrained, with one local columnist even describing it as “stingy,” given that New York promised more than $1.5 billion in direct subsidies, while Maryland and New Jersey pledged billions in their failed bids to attract Amazon. On the other hand, New York officials have said the Empire State’s higher costs contributed to its offer’s being more generous. And a CNN report argued that New Yorkers could fare better because their minimum-wage laws will ensure decent pay for the thousands of new jobs that Amazon could indirectly create.Check out: Activists protest Amazon’s HQ2 in New YorkAnd see: HQ2 in the D.C. area could help Amazon snag a $10 billion Pentagon contractThe biggest misconception about developments in Virginia related to Amazon’s HQ2 is that “it’s all going to come tomorrow,” Touhill told MarketWatch. “This is going to roll out over 12 to 15 years.”Victor Reklaitis is MarketWatch's Money & Politics reporter and is based in Washington, D.C.

But with the streaming-video company heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing, DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote Monday, one possible overhang on Roku shares could be removed—at least for a while.“The truce alleviates (but does not eliminate) a significant near-term risk to shares of Roku,” Forte wrote. “At current prices, we believe other risks, such as competition with Amazon.com (AMZN), are currently priced into [the] shares.”DA Davidson has a Buy rating and a $49 price target on Roku stock, more than 16% above current levels. The shares, down more than 20% in 2018 despite posting big gains earlier in the year, were up more than 4% to above $42 in Monday morning trading.Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Roku stock. The average price target is near $68, according to FactSet.Roku’s players—disclosure: Our household added one recently thanks to Black Friday pricing—are mainly made in China by Foxconn, then shipped to the U.S. and U.K., according to company filings. (Its speakers are made by another Chinese company, Tonly.)Roku’s revenue is spread between licensing, advertising and revenue- sharing with partners. As the company grows, device-related revenues should become a smaller percentage of total sales. In the third quarter, player revenues were 42% of the company’s total, down from more than half a year earlier. (Barron’s spoke with CFO Steve Louden in November after the company’s latest quarterly report.)“We are impressed by Roku’s leadership role in the emerging over-the-top video consumption market and are optimistic on its ability to exploit the $70 billion TV advertising spending market,” Forte wrote. We “believe the combination of the truce and where shares are currently trading provide an attractive buying opportunity for investors.”Email David Marino-Nachison at david.marino-nachison@barrons.com.

If successful, the strategy would further challenge brick-and-mortar retailers racing to make their businesses more convenient.The online retail giant is experimenting with the technology in Seattle in a larger space formatted like a big store, the people said. The systems track what shoppers pick from shelves and charges them automatically when they leave a store. Although the technology functions well in its current small-store format, it is harder to use the technology in bigger spaces with higher ceilings and more products, one of the people said, meaning it could take time to roll out the systems at more larger stores.It is unclear whether Amazon  AMZN, +4.86%    intends to use the technology for Whole Foods, although that is the most likely application if executives can make it work, according to the people. Amazon has previously said it has no plans to add the technology to Whole Foods. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company doesn’t comment on rumors and speculation. Whole Foods declined to comment.The cashierless system is already in use at seven Amazon Go convenience stores in Seattle, Chicago and San Francisco.

AMZN,12/01/18,Utility stocks have beaten the S&P 500 in two months of turbulence and in the long run,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/utility-stocks-have-beaten-the-sp-500-in-two-months-of-turbulence-and-in-the-long-run-2018-11-28,"The S&P 500 utilities sector has been the best performer during the market decline that began in October. Don’t roll your eyes.We know it may not be a surprise, as utility companies offer investors a haven in times of turbulence. But what may interest you is how much better this stodgy sector’s performance has been over long periods.From the end of September, the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.09%  has declined 8%, including reinvested dividends, while the S&P 500 utilities sector returned a positive 3.3%. Here’s a chart showing how well the 12 sectors of the S&P 500 Index have fared over various periods:The S&P 500 utilities sector has been the best during the post-September market turmoil and has ranked second for 2018 through Nov. 26. But if you look at the longer periods, the total returns exceed those of the entire S&P 500 for all periods except for 10 years.But that 10-year figure is a bit deceptive. You need to consider what occurred before this 10-year period began. The S&P 500 was down 34% (including reinvested dividends) for two years through Nov. 26, 2008, while the utilities sector suffered a far milder 13% decline.The 20-year chart shows that, for the most part, the utilities sector has had less “downside capture” than the index:There’s no question that over the past five years, the information-technology sector, driven by the market-cap-weighted performance of the FAANG companies (Facebook FB, +0.34% Apple AAPL, +3.49% Amazon AMZN, +4.86% Netflix NFLX, +1.46%  and Alphabet GOOG, +1.10% ), has been the place to be. But the FAANG stocks have all fared even worse than the S&P 500 since the end of September, despite the companies’ fast growth.The 15-year and 20-year returns give evidence to the importance of the utilities sector: People and companies need those services in what is a critical industry protected by regulators. Utilities also reward investors with steady dividend payouts.Concentrating on individual stocks can be a risky endeavor. Shares of PG&E Corp. PCG, +2.77% the owner of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., are down 47% for 2018. Investors have worried that the company may be held liable for the California wildfires. Then again, some investors have looked at the decline as an opportunity.Regardless of how the PG&E saga plays out, there’s no question that a safer way for investors to gain exposure to the utilities sector is through an exchange traded fund, such as the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLU, +1.01%  the Vanguard Utilities ETF  VPU, +0.86%   or the iShares U.S. Utilities ETF  IDU, +0.95%Here are all 29 stocks included in the S&P 500 utilities sector, ranked by how well they have performed over the past five years:You can click on the tickers for more about each company, including news, profiles, charts, ratings and financials.Don’t miss: These stocks are in bear territory, but analysts expect them to roar backCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn’s Deep Dive columns here.Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

AMZN,11/30/18,The Boom in Big Data,https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-big-investors-use-your-personal-data-to-play-the-stock-market-1543627499,"Even before the hip teenagers realized that nobody goes to the mall anymore, about a dozen math and science Ph.Ds packed into a co-working office in downtown Manhattan already knew it. On their computers, the Ph.Ds started to see a decline in the number of “pings” from cellphones that they were tracking in those malls. And that drop-off became an important signal for the stock market well before some malls announced disappointing financial results.In a similar way, web-scraping company Thinknum in June noticed a drop in job listings on a Tesla site the day before the company announced a restructuring. And long before it became clear that Adidas was stealing market share from Nike and Under Armour, consumers who filled out online surveys created for investment bank Cowen & Co. started to say they preferred Adidas.For savvy investors, such information presented buying and selling opportunities.That kind of edge can be worth paying for, particularly at a time when traditional value-investing strategies are floundering and companies are withholding significant data from investors. Just a few weeks ago, Apple said it would no longer tell investors how many iPhones it sells each quarter.The explosive growth of digital data, along with better tools to analyze and store it, has jump-started a once-niche industry that packages under-the-radar information for investors. Once standardized, the numbers can be plugged into computers, creating “big data” that helps investors predict.While alternative data—like geolocation data that track the location of cellphones, or language-tracking software that detects changes in sentiment around a company—have been available for years, such data sets are increasingly becoming a more mainstream tool. Portfolio managers who have historically done most of their research using quarterly financial releases are now examining real-time feeds of credit-card transactions and social-media sentiment.“This data is lying all over the place,” says Michael Recce, who became the first chief data scientist at asset manager Neuberger Berman last year. “If we can analyze it and figure out who’s really gaining market share, then we can make better investment decisions. Knowing exactly who is winning in the marketplace in real time is going to be a huge advantage.”Recce is convinced that with the right data sets, firms like his will be able to use information like credit-card receipts to “see Tim Cook’s dashboard”—the company’s most important statistics—even if the Apple CEO would rather keep it hidden.Research has always been important for portfolio managers as an ancillary service. But now the stat guys aren’t being put in a corner anymore. Neuberger expects Recce to eventually run his own portfolio.Other companies known for fundamental investing processes are quickly staffing up, too. A new division at JPMorgan Chase (ticker: JPM) called Intelligent Digital Solutions is looking for coders and Ph.Ds who will work with asset-management teams managing $2 trillion. In December, it will hold its first “data science hackathon,” bringing quantitative and fundamental analysts together with data scientists to crowdsource investment ideas using alternative data. It’s a “paradigm shift” in how the firm invests, says Ravit Mandell, the chief data scientist at J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management.The trend has even been embraced by some pension funds, historically among the most conservative investors. Marcel Prins, the chief operating officer of APG Asset Management, which manages the pensions of one in five Dutch families, says that using such data is now “part of being an active long-term responsible investor.”The push comes at a time when diving for data on consumers is under scrutiny. Facebook has been widely criticized for amassing and sharing enormous caches of personal information, stoking worries about data privacy around the world. So far, regulators have taken little action to stop investors from accessing alternative data, even when it comes from the credit cards and cellphones of consumers. But they may not stay silent for long.“I find it hard to believe that eventually this intersection between privacy issues and insider-trading issues isn’t going to be of some interest to folks like the New York attorney general or the Securities and Exchange Commission,” says Jonathan Streeter, a former federal prosecutor who is now a lawyer at Dechert and one of the go-to legal experts in the field.In his first few years in the private sector, he rarely heard the term alternative data from the asset managers he represented. About 18 months ago, he started receiving an influx of calls from fund managers wondering about the legal implications of using it. “The number of clients asking about it, and the number of events I’m asked to give speeches at, has ramped way up.”Most firms are just dipping their toes in the water. The average institutional investment firm spends about $900,000 annually on alternative data, according to a report from Greenwich Associates, which surveyed 40 investment managers around the world. Investors will spend about $300 million on these data sets this year, up from $170 million in 2017, the company projects.That’s a tiny sliver of the total value of financial data—spending on products from companies like Bloomberg and FactSet totaled $28.5 billion last year, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting. But alternative data are undoubtedly making up a larger percentage every year. Bloomberg itself has been providing some of these data for almost a decade and has recently been adding new products, including satellite and geolocation information.“ I find it hard to believe that eventually this intersection between privacy issues and insider-trading issues isn’t going to be of some interest to folks like the New York attorney general or the Securities and Exchange Commission. ”The growing interest is also evident in the guest list for Discovery Intrepid, an annual conference put on by alternative-data company BattleFin on a decommissioned aircraft carrier in New York. Whereas, two years ago, 90% of the passes to the conference were bought by quants—hedge fund managers who use systematic computer-driven strategies—it’s now “closer to 50/50” quants and more traditional asset managers, says Tim Harrington, BattleFin’s CEO. The number of data providers presenting at the conference quintupled, to 153.Overall, there are now more than 1,000 data providers charging anywhere from a few thousand dollars a year to several hundred thousand, experts say.“The quants were very much the early adopters, and now there’s a transition where the discretionary and fundamental world is waking up to it,” Harrington says.Harrington himself came from the world of traditional investing. He was an analyst at Steven Cohen’s SAC Capital for years, covering telecommunications. He remembers driving to retail phone stores to talk to managers and see what was selling. Now, through BattleFin’s platform, he sells a product that tracks every time a new phone is turned on and can find out quickly “which wireless carriers are gaining subscribers and which are losing them,” he says.Using alternative data is nothing new. For years, investors have used methods like channel checks—calls to a company’s supply-chain partners—to gain an information edge. Even longer ago, Babylonian commodity traders would measure the depth of the Euphrates river to see which crops were likely to grow best, according to Ashby Monk, the executive director of Stanford University’s Global Projects Center.“Ultimately, alternative data is just data,” says Monk, who has written extensively on the use of new kinds of investment data. “It’s only defined as alternative because we actually took the time to define conventional. We define it as the thing that is not commonly used in investment decision-making but which could have value.”The new era of alternative data started after the financial crisis, says Leigh Drogen, the CEO of Estimize, which sells an alternate set of earnings estimates using its own survey. After 2008, the next generation of hedge funds “were forced to go out and actually generate idiosyncratic alpha,” he says. “Well, there ain’t that much idiosyncratic alpha out there for people picking stocks.” One idea they latched on to was to “try and leverage all this unique data,” he says.And the world has become awash in data.“As a society, we produced more data last year than we did in the whole history of humanity,” notes Tobias Moskowitz, a finance professor at Yale School of Management who is also a principal at Cliff Asness’s quantitative investment firm AQR Capital Management. “That data is being captured all the time. Everything is recorded.”Gathering data today doesn’t involve driving to every cellphone store in a state to ask how business is doing. Mundane activities—surfing the web, buying something with a credit card—now leave terabytes’ worth of digital clues. Much of it is considered “waste” or “exhaust”—information that’s created in the normal course of doing another kind of business. The people who make the weather or map apps on your phone track your location so they can give you accurate information about the weather. It just so happens that they can also sell that information to hedge funds, which use it to determine where people are shopping. There are hundreds of such apps that track locations with the permission of the people who download them.Other companies then turn that raw data into useful forms. New York–based Thasos Group gathers anonymized location data from about 500 million phones that are running any one of more than 1,000 apps. The information comes into the company’s computers as dots on a map, as in the case of the shopping malls. The firm’s software links the signal counts associated with those mapped malls to the tickers of retailers or publicly traded mall owners, to see where traffic is growing or shrinking over time.Thasos allows investors to see which mall customers are from wealthier census blocks, and which shop at multiple malls, among other insights. Bond investors can search by individual mall properties to determine if they’re likely to stay creditworthy.It’s an incredibly laborious process, one that took Thasos six years to nail down. “It’s like understanding particle behavior and trying to build a model,” says Thasos CEO Greg Skibiski. “It’s physics basically that we do here.”The company sells the full package of the product directly to investors for $100,000 to $200,000, and Bloomberg is offering a version of it directly through its terminal.In July 2017, Thasos issued a press release showing foot-traffic data for the five top-performing and five bottom-performing real estate investment trust among the 30 largest ones that the company was tracking. The company’s predictions weren’t perfect—it said Simon Property Group (SPG) was lagging behind, but that company ended up increasing its earnings guidance—but the malls it said were winners all had positive price moves after reporting earnings, and three of the five companies it said would lag behind fell after reporting earnings. Several mall operators are themselves now buying data from Thasos, the company says.Thasos has dozens of clients, but it’s still relatively rare for most fund managers to pay for cellphone-location information, says Richard Johnson, an analyst with Greenwich Associates. About 10% of the money managers Greenwich surveyed used it.“The location data gets a lot of headlines, but it doesn’t seem to get a lot of usage,” he says. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, he adds. “The ones people aren’t using now may have the most value,” he says.Geolocation information from another company called Alpha Hat has been helpful for Chuck Grom, a retail analyst at Gordon Haskett, a boutique research advisory firm. He used the information to write a note this year explaining to clients why Kohl’s had made a smart move by partnering with Amazon.com to allow people to return Amazon goods to certain Kohl’s stores. Stores where people could make Amazon returns had 8.5% higher traffic than stores where it wasn’t available, Grom wrote in a note to clients. By using data on how much time each customer spent in the store, he projected that customers weren’t just stopping by to make a return—they were actively shopping, too.“It’s a lot more of a refined approach than an image of cars in a parking lot,” he says.Among the most popular kinds of alternative data are those from credit and debit cards. Earnest Research compiles anonymized reports of spending by millions of consumers at hundreds of companies. It doesn’t get every credit-card transaction, but a broad enough swath that “we have data on any company in the U.S. that accepts electronic payments,” CEO Kevin Carson tells Barron’s. The company keeps the exact source a secret. “We can’t say specifically where we get it from,” he says.Earnest can track “essentially what you would see on your debit- or credit-card statement,” he says, so it would include the size of the purchase and name of the company, but not exactly what the person bought. And it’s not just for retailers. Earnest can see how much people are spending on things like cable bills, too, Carson says.Other providers gather spending information by interviewing people. Cowen & Co. has surveyed consumers for years to provide exclusive sentiment information for the research it sells to investors. Now, through a new entity called Kyber Data Science, it sells the information directly to investors.Eyes in the sky are also watching. Orbital Insight, based in Palo Alto, Calif., uses satellites, drones, balloons, and unmanned aerial vehicles to snap photos, capturing information that would be tough to map from ground level. It’s not just useful for checking how many cars are in the parking lot at Home Depot. Orbital says it can help answer crucial macroeconomic questions, like whether China is building more roads today than it did last quarter. Orbital also became available on Bloomberg this year and on CME DataMine.Fund managers report mixed success at using satellite information. The investment firm AQR, for instance, has tested satellite data and found the benefits from them to be “fleeting” once the data became used more widely, Moskowitz says. “The data that gets a lot of hype is generally very fleeting. Markets figure it out pretty quickly.”Drones aren’t necessary to gather some data. Web-scraping companies can derive information by building software that tracks changes to sites that post information like job listings or company sentiment information on sites like Glassdoor. That’s how the web-scraping company Thinknum recognized that Tesla job openings had suddenly dropped in June, just before a restructuring was announced. Thinknum provides data on 400,000 companies, both public and private.A similar company, YipitData, also collects and analyzes web information, but has narrowed its focus to 60 companies. By counting restaurants that partner with Grubhub and UberEats, it has compiled detailed data on who’s winning the food-delivery battle, for instance. “If you’re investing in Grubhub, you need that answer,” CEO Vinicius Vacanti says.Quantitative investors who plug all of this information into computers say they often backtest the sets for a year or more. At Two Sigma, another hedge fund known for strong results, the strategy can involve thousands of data sets.“To be able to predict, you need to start with a ground-level understanding of the real world as it stands today,” says Ali-Milan Nekmouche, chief data strategist at Two Sigma. “We use our platform to measure real world economic activity in a granular way.” Both Two Sigma and AQR caution that investors shouldn’t look at these sets in isolation. Before inputting data it’s important for a firm to have a “solid interpretation engine,” Nekmouche says.AQR starts with economic theories and plugs the data in to test its hypotheses and guide trading ideas. “I think it’s very dangerous if you just take the data and throw it against the wall and see what happens,” Moskowitz says.Even the best predictive data can be tough to trade around. Web-scraped information that showed Tesla was slowing its hiring didn’t predict how to profit off the information. An investor who shorted Tesla stock expecting a slowdown to worry Wall Street would have lost money: The stock actually rose on the day of the restructuring news.Among the biggest wild cards in this industry is the threat of regulation. The SEC has cracked down on tools that give investors an edge, including so-called expert networks that claimed to offer insights from consultants. So far, alternative data have mostly steered clear of such scrutiny. Streeter, the Dechert attorney, says the SEC has been watching alternative data, though there have been no enforcement actions.The SEC declined to comment for this article, and the New York Attorney General’s Office did not respond to a request for comment.Katya Chupryna, the chief strategy officer of Thinknum, says the industry has been serious about self-policing, banding together to create its own regulatory groups and come up with definitions of “personally identifiable information.” She adds, “Because there are no standards, we are trying to build those standards ourselves, but always on the cautious side.”Hedge funds are wary of attracting regulatory attention and tend to vet data sets extensively, several industry insiders say. Unlike advertisers, they have no interest in targeting individual consumers for marketing purposes.Streeter sees evidence that the industry is serious about self-policing, but he has looked at some situations that fell into a gray area.“I have encountered situations where a vendor is offering to not only tell you how many cellphones were inside Best Buy on a particular day but also to tell you where the people live,” he says. “And the way they figure that out is they follow those cellphones to where they go to bed at night and sit for 10 hours and wake up in the morning. That to me is a closer call, and I think that the law around that is undeveloped.”Even if such collection doesn’t violate a specific legal principle, it “starts to raise more significant privacy concerns,” he says.Phone-location information has drawn some interest from legislators. Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile U.S. all limited the location information they provide to data brokers in June after criticism from Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. That didn’t stop phone companies from disseminating some information to third parties, and it didn’t stop apps from tracking phones.Wyden wants to go further. He released a draft of a bill in November that would give consumers more power over the personal information that corporations collect, including location data. “There is clearly a vast, largely unregulated market where companies, data brokers, asset managers, and others swap and sell Americans’ personal information,” he said. “This market is sorely in need of radical transparency, real oversight, and tough penalties for those who misuse our data or lie about protecting our information.”Thasos can pinpoint the census block area where a cellphone’s signal originates, but it makes sure that all personally identifiable information is scrubbed from the information before it enters the company’s system, CEO Skibiski says. That condition is in its contracts with all of the apps it works with, he says. “I’m super-privacy-sensitive myself,” he says.Other data sets have also generated some scrutiny. In 2015, Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers said they were able to identify people using a small amount of information in credit-card purchase databases, even when those purchases were made anonymous. Kevin Carson, of Earnest, says that its products “are delivered to clients in aggregate form, and do not contain any personal information.”Privacy advocates haven’t been particularly focused on alternative investment data, but see echoes of other recent controversies in the field.“Hedge funds are seen as bad actors in other ways, but are not seen as the biggest baddest privacy actors yet,” says Gennie Gebhart, associate director of research at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Making data anonymous is easier said than done, she says.“It’s incredibly hard to make a truly anonymized data set” at a time when there’s a growing business in deanonymizing consumer data, she says. “Anytime you’re combining disparate data sets, there is the risk of creating new privacy-invasive information or assumptions.”Want to learn more?

AMZN,11/30/18,"Chinese biotech stocks hit by a double whammy, which means it’s time to buy",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-biotech-stocks-hit-by-a-double-whammy-which-means-its-time-to-buy-2018-11-30,"Have investors hit peak negativity on China-based companies? I think there’s a good chance they have. If so, it’s time to buy China stocks, especially in biotechnology.Chinese biotech stocks have been particularly hammered because they are getting hit by a double whammy. They’re down because investors are overly negative on China due to trade-war tensions. And unlike the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.09% the U.S. biotech sector is actually already in a bear market. The SPDR S&P Biotech exchange traded fund XBI, +3.65% was recently down 25% from its summer highs.I’ll tell you the best way to buy China biotech stocks — and it is surprisingly easy. But first let’s look at why the worries behind the selloff in China stocks and biotech in general are overblown.On China fears, it’s key to keep in mind that President Donald Trump’s negotiating style is to start with bluster (which spooks investors) and then dial back to compromise to be able to boast about a “deal.”That’s going to be the case with China trade. One reason is that, near term, neither country can stand — or deserves — the pain that comes from a harsh trade regime.U.S. companies have extensive supply chains winding through China, which will be hard and costly to replace. U.S. consumers enjoy the cheap, yet high-quality, goods that come out of China — everything from guitars to Apple AAPL, +3.49%  iPhones. China needs U.S. markets and access to U.S. business partnerships, and university slots for students.So we’re going to see signs of progress on China trade talks and probably soon — at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Nov. 30 through Dec. 1.“The majority of clients believe there will be a truce, meaning there will be an agreement to resume negotiations and there will be no increase in tariffs over that period,” says John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy at J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.94%Even if we don’t get any signs of progress on China trade tensions, it never made sense that China biotech stocks should get hit by this war on trade. After all, who would hold human lives hostage to politics?On the biotech weakness, the key thing to remember here is that the selloff has little to do with sector trends, says Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee. It’s more about investors fleeing a high-beta group in a risk-off environment. When investor confidence returns, which is likely because there’s no looming recession and because the Fed will probably soon signal it’s reducing the number of planned rate hikes, high-beta groups like biotech will be among the best performers. China biotech stocks look like a great way to position for this kind of move, given the double whammy at work.But how to get access? Here you’re in luck. For the past few years biotech expert Brad Loncar has been travelling to China to meet with biotech companies and study which ones to put in a China biotech index he’s devised. Now there’s a an ETF based on that index. It’s called the Loncar China BioPharma ETF CHNA, +1.70%Loncar got a big break in this effort when Hong Kong recently loosened listing standards for companies, in that they’re no longer required to show revenue. This opened the door to listings of China biotech companies on the Hong Kong exchange. That’s a good thing for investors, because the Hong Kong exchange has fairly stringent listing standards. Mistakes will get through, but this generally means investors are less likely to buy into a fraud when they buy a Hong Kong-listed China biotech stock.The Loncar China BioPharma ETF gives you easy access to 28 biotech companies. Based on a small sampling of this group that I’ve studied and suggested in my stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks, these are quality companies with decent prospects. One of them is BeiGene BGNE, -1.64% which I first suggested in my letter at $28 in February 2016. It was up 685% by June 2018. And even in the biotech rout it is still up 400%. (My current buy limit is $100, give or take a little.) Another of mine in the Loncar ETF is the small-cap CASI Pharmaceuticals CASI, +5.31% This one advanced 270% after I suggested it in the low $2 range in early November 2017. I recently reiterated it because it looks attractive again in the pullback below $4.The Loncar China BioPharma ETF gives you access to plenty more potential China biotech winners like these, but it has one shortcoming, at least for now. Volume and liquidity are low, which means the bid-ask spread is wide. One way around this is to put in a limit buy order near the bid, and camp out until it gets hit.Besides an expected truce in the war on trade with China, which will soon put a bid under Chinese stocks again, here are four other reasons why it makes sense to invest in Chinese biotech for the long haul.1. The government really wants the sector to winUntil recently, China had no biotech or pharma sector speak of. Most pharma companies either developed generic drugs or manufactured drugs. “They didn’t do innovation or create new drugs, but that is changing dramatically overnight,” says Loncar. Biotech is a key part of the country’s efforts to spur continued growth by developing more sophisticated companies.2. The Hong Kong exchange now welcomes revenue-light businesses from China“That basically describes 99% of biotech companies,” Loncar, because they tend to be early-stage, developing businesses. The Hong Kong change is “huge” for China’s biotech sector, says Loncar, because it gives venture-capital firms an easier way to exit investments to realize gains, and put the money into start-ups. “That is super-important because it creates an ecosystem for investing in biotech for the first time,” says Loncar.3. China FDA upgradeChina has completely revamped its version of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to bring it up to global standards, says Loncar. This improves the quality of the sector, and piques investor interest.4. U.S.-trained talent is returning homeMajor China companies including Tencent TCEHY, +3.44% Baidu BIDU, +1.62% and Alibaba BABA, +1.79% exist, in part, because Chinese nationals who studied in the U.S. and worked at U.S. companies like Google GOOG, +1.10%GOOGL, +0.60% Facebook FB, +0.34% and Amazon.com AMZN, +4.86% returned to China to work in tech start-ups.“A lot of Chinese professionals who were educated in the U.S. and worked at U.S. biotech companies are going home now and starting biotech companies,” says Loncar.Those four factors add up to a “perfect storm” that should create a solid biotech sector in the country over the next several years. If so, now is the time to buy in.Keep in mind that even if these stocks get a boost near term on signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks, this group will be volatile because U.S.-China tensions will persist for decades as the two great powers battle for global hegemony.But there may be some good news in this, too. Persistent trade tensions could increase China’s focus on developing its biotech sector, as a way to move away from reliance on trade for growth, says Loncar. “They’re going to have world-class biotech sector, I have no doubt about that.”At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

AMZN,11/30/18,"Sell U.S. Tech Stocks, Buy Emerging Markets, Says Rob Arnott",https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-u-s-tech-stocks-buy-emerging-markets-says-rob-arnott-1543516901,"Investors may be thrilled that U.S. stocks have rallied, pushing the S&P 500 to a 4.4% total return for the year, including dividends, as of the close on Wednesday. But the good times probably won’t last, according to Rob Arnott, founder of the investment research firm Research Affiliates and co-manager of funds such as Pimco All Asset All Authority (ticker: PAUAX).A value-oriented contrarian, Arnott has long warned that U.S. stocks look pricey. And he’s especially concerned now that a handful of big tech stocks are carrying the market on their shoulders.“U.S. stocks have gotten frothy and expensive,” Arnott told Barron’s in an interview. “The FAANG stocks, in particular, are priced for perfection. If they don’t reinforce the notion that they’ll be 10 times as large a decade from now, then they’re overpriced and will perform badly.”The FAANGs refer to Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Along with a few other big-tech stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Chinese internet firms Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU), they have become a huge source of market concentration and power: Their total equity value tops $4.2 trillion, and they have been fueling the market’s gains.“The seven or eight largest companies on the planet are all tech darlings,” says Arnott. “Is that a diversified roster of top tier companies? Hardly.”Arnott points out that U.S. stocks trade at 30 times earnings, based on the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE) from the last 10 years, a valuation measure developed by Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller. The CAPE ratio only topped 30 once in history, just before the dot-com collapse, he says.Emerging markets, by contrast, look like a screaming buy. They trade at a CAPE ratio of 13. Investors worry that declining currencies and commodity prices will keep emerging markets depressed, and that the trade war between the U.S. and China will continue to be a drag on growth.But Arnott views those fears as overblown. “Will the trade war materially change the trajectory of half the world’s gross domestic product over the next 10 years?” he asks. “The answer is no.You cannot have a bargain in the absence of bad news that could get worse before it gets better. If you can accept that, then you have an opportunity to get some very good deals.”Granted, investors in Pimco All Asset All Authority haven’t seen great returns. The fund is down about 7% this year, and its 10-year annualized return of 5% trails 90% of mutual funds in the moderate-target-risk category, according to Morningstar.Arnott points out that most funds in the category are typically anchored to a 60/40 mix of stocks and bonds. All Authority aims to be different, holding what he calls “third-pillar” assets that can protect investors in a bear market and should do well in an inflationary environment: commodities, Treasury-inflation protected securities, and real-estate investment trusts. He also likes “stealth inflation fighters” such as emerging-market stocks and bonds, and high-yield U.S. junk bonds.Moreover, the fund is typically short the U.S. stock market, betting it will go down. “We actually have to love U.S. stocks in order to go above 0% in net U.S. stock exposure in All Authority,” he wrote in an email to Barron’s. Not surprisingly, he added, our returns “are in line with our home-base third pillar markets.”Those markets had an average return of 0.8% over the last five years. “That’s why our return lagged US stock-centric approaches—not because we’ve had an increasingly cautious view on U.S. equities,” he said.Still, it has been a painful slog for investors who have stuck with the fund while U.S. stocks have climbed, rising at a 14% annualized gain over the last decade, based on returns for the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY).“All Authority’s home base–away from mainstream stocks and bonds–will reliably lead to underperformance in a bull market,” Arnott tells Barron’s. “That’s what diversification does in a bull market.” At the end of what is now the longest bull market in history, he adds, “this is not a time to worry about the drag imposed by diversifying asset classes. “Indeed, Arnott sees a good chance that markets will start moving in his favor: He pegs the odds of a bear market breaking out in the U.S. in the near term at 40%. Investors might do well in a fund without much correlation to U.S. stocks in that scenario, though as he acknowledges, they may have to wait for their patience to be rewarded.“Do I have high confidence that the asset classes we focus on will beat U.S. stocks next year? No,” he says. “But I have high confidence they’ll win over a 10-year horizon.”Write to Daren Fonda at daren.fonda@barrons.com"
AMZN,11/30/18,Hedge Funds Were Selling FAANG Stocks Before They Sank,https://www.barrons.com/articles/hedge-funds-were-selling-faang-stocks-before-they-sank-1543597324,"FAANG stocks have had one of their worst routs in recent months, with all of the them dipping into bear-market levels at some point–meaning share prices plunging 20% or more from the latest peak.Some hedge funds might have avoided part of that damage by selling the FAANGs early enough.In the third quarter, hedge funds sold over $34 billion in stocks–about 2% of their total assets, Jefferies strategist Steven DeSanctis writes in a Friday research report.It’s worth noting that the S&P 500 did not start dropping until Oct. 3; but hedge funds were already reducing weight in stocks throughout the third quarter in anticipation of higher risks and a trend change in the equity market.More noticeable was the sharp decline in their FAANG exposure. Hedge-fund managers reduced 14.6% of their FAANG holdings in the third quarter. Facebook (FB), whose shares are now 36.2% down from a July peak, saw hedge funds cut their holdings in the social network by 28%–a whopping $7.5 billion.Hedge funds were getting rid of FAANG stock before they slid. During the third quarter, while Facebook tumbled 16.7% and Netflix (NFLX) lost 6.0%, the other three FAANGs– Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon.com (AMZN)–made gains. The FAANG stocks topped out at different times this summer, Barron’s noted.DeSanctis thinks hedge funds might be selling for another reason too: They were trying to raise more cash in preparation for next year’s redemption. Hedge-fund performance has been weak throughout 2018, even when compared with exchange-traded and mutual funds. Some managers might be anticipating more redemption from investors in 2019 and getting ready with their cash flow, writes DeSanctis.Whatever the reason, hedge funds’ shedding of FAANG stock has certainly contributed to the further turmoil for the group in October and November. In the fourth quarter so far through Thursday, all FAANGs were in negative territory, with losses ranging from 9.0% to 24.3%.“If this [hedge-fund] money comes back to the market, it potentially provides some fuel for a nice rally,” writes DeSanctis.Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com"

For each 10 positive ratings of companies in the S&P 500 index, there is only a single negative one, according to a Barron’s screen of FactSet data. So thumbs-down reports tend to stand out.For example, Morgan Stanley on Thursday published a list of its favorite “secular growth stocks,” which the firm’s analysts reckon can “grow strongly independent of global economic conditions.”There are some predictable names, like Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), and some picks that are less universally adored, like the biotech firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Assurant (AIZ), which sells, among other things, extended warranties for smartphones. But a companion list of “secularly challenged stocks” was perhaps more eye-catching.Listen to a conversation between Jack Hough and Alex Eule about what to do with Facebook’s unloved stock in a recent episode of The Readback. You can sign up for the podcast in iTunes or wherever you listen to podcasts.That list includes stocks rated Underweight by Morgan Stanley’s analysts, where the price target is near or below the recent share price. Risk and reward for each are skewed unfavorably, with potential downside in a bearish scenario exceeding potential upside in a bullish one. And for each, the analyst’s negative thesis rests on more than fleeting problems—things like rising competition or deteriorating end markets. Among 25 stocks on the list, the 10 listed below had bear cases that implied at least 60% downside from recent levels.Two important caveats: First, bear cases aren’t what the firm sees as the likeliest outcome for each stock.

BIDU,12/03/2018 10:06,India’s Former Central Bank Chief on How to Fix the Country’s Economy,https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-to-fix-india-economy-1543857482,"Within emerging markets, India is seen as less vulnerable to the trade skirmishes playing out between the U.S. and China. That’s a positive, but the country is facing another set of challenges, from a deepening credit crunch and persistent bad debts at its public-sector banks, to a sizable fiscal deficit and an economy not growing as fast as it can.In our recent conversation with Raghuram Rajan, the former head of India’s central bank put some of India’s challenges in perspective—and offered ways to address them. Here are some more highlights of that discussion on India.India’s deficit put it in the “Fragile Five” group of countries deemed financially vulnerable back in 2013. Rajan helped get the country on a better course, in part by tackling inflation. The rupee weakened against the dollar to an all-time low this fall, and there are renewed jitters about India’s fiscal deficit.Rajan said some of the decline in the currency was natural as the rupee adjusted to the lower inflation rate. As for the deficit, Rajan says that India’s fiscal deficit has stayed around 7% of GDP, in part because an increase at the state level has offset reductions elsewhere. The country’s economic growth has kept a lid on the debt level, though Rajan says that is not something the country can rely on forever.India’s economic growth slowed to 7.1% in the second quarter—still among the fastest in the world but not fast enough. Rajan thinks the economy needs to grow at a pace of 9% to 10%, considering India needs to create one new million jobs a month. The easiest way to do that is to make it easier to build in India and increase the role of the construction industry through structural reforms, like making land acquisition easier—something that the federal government has grappled with for a while.“The reality is a number of states have figured out the secret sauce and the government needs to examine the experience and make it universal,” Rajan says. For example, the state of Uttar Pradesh came up with ways where it bought land from farmers by promising them some of it back after development.“The government getting involved in land acquisition is the third rail of Indian politics,” Rajan says. “As soon as the government pushes it in a big way, there are accusations it is favoring one group over the other. You have to find ways to assuage concerns and make it more transparent but also make sure India gets roads, highways and ports we absolutely need.”While at the Reserve Bank of India, Rajan tried to address the bad debt at the country’s public sector banks. But banks are still struggling with the issue. Part of the issue is that India didn’t have a bankruptcy court for years.For years, India and technology were synonymous. But there’s less talk about India in the new frontiers of technology, like robotics and artificial intelligence, which concerns Rajan. “There are start-ups that you may not have heard of but which are doing some interesting things, including [artificial intelligence],” Rajan says. “But they are at much smaller levels at this point than  Baidu,Alibaba, and  Tencent. The traditional IT giants will have to work very hard to have a presence in some of these frontier industries. Thus far, it seems to me it’s been slow.”India’s stocks have fallen sharply this year, and the  iShares MSCI India  ETF (INDA) is down about 8% this year. But in a note to clients last week, Gavekal Research strategists said they don’t see much potential for a bounce back more so than in other emerging markets. Despite the sell-off, Gavekal analysts noted that Indian equities are still trading at a 50% premium over emerging market peers—a large gap even if the economy is among the world’s fastest-growing.Write to Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.com"
BIDU,11/30/18,"Chinese biotech stocks hit by a double whammy, which means it’s time to buy",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-biotech-stocks-hit-by-a-double-whammy-which-means-its-time-to-buy-2018-11-30,"Have investors hit peak negativity on China-based companies? I think there’s a good chance they have. If so, it’s time to buy China stocks, especially in biotechnology.Chinese biotech stocks have been particularly hammered because they are getting hit by a double whammy. They’re down because investors are overly negative on China due to trade-war tensions. And unlike the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.09% the U.S. biotech sector is actually already in a bear market. The SPDR S&P Biotech exchange traded fund XBI, +3.65% was recently down 25% from its summer highs.I’ll tell you the best way to buy China biotech stocks — and it is surprisingly easy. But first let’s look at why the worries behind the selloff in China stocks and biotech in general are overblown.On China fears, it’s key to keep in mind that President Donald Trump’s negotiating style is to start with bluster (which spooks investors) and then dial back to compromise to be able to boast about a “deal.”That’s going to be the case with China trade. One reason is that, near term, neither country can stand — or deserves — the pain that comes from a harsh trade regime.U.S. companies have extensive supply chains winding through China, which will be hard and costly to replace. U.S. consumers enjoy the cheap, yet high-quality, goods that come out of China — everything from guitars to Apple AAPL, +3.49%  iPhones. China needs U.S. markets and access to U.S. business partnerships, and university slots for students.So we’re going to see signs of progress on China trade talks and probably soon — at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Nov. 30 through Dec. 1.“The majority of clients believe there will be a truce, meaning there will be an agreement to resume negotiations and there will be no increase in tariffs over that period,” says John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy at J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.94%Even if we don’t get any signs of progress on China trade tensions, it never made sense that China biotech stocks should get hit by this war on trade. After all, who would hold human lives hostage to politics?On the biotech weakness, the key thing to remember here is that the selloff has little to do with sector trends, says Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee. It’s more about investors fleeing a high-beta group in a risk-off environment. When investor confidence returns, which is likely because there’s no looming recession and because the Fed will probably soon signal it’s reducing the number of planned rate hikes, high-beta groups like biotech will be among the best performers. China biotech stocks look like a great way to position for this kind of move, given the double whammy at work.But how to get access? Here you’re in luck. For the past few years biotech expert Brad Loncar has been travelling to China to meet with biotech companies and study which ones to put in a China biotech index he’s devised. Now there’s a an ETF based on that index. It’s called the Loncar China BioPharma ETF CHNA, +1.70%Loncar got a big break in this effort when Hong Kong recently loosened listing standards for companies, in that they’re no longer required to show revenue. This opened the door to listings of China biotech companies on the Hong Kong exchange. That’s a good thing for investors, because the Hong Kong exchange has fairly stringent listing standards. Mistakes will get through, but this generally means investors are less likely to buy into a fraud when they buy a Hong Kong-listed China biotech stock.The Loncar China BioPharma ETF gives you easy access to 28 biotech companies. Based on a small sampling of this group that I’ve studied and suggested in my stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks, these are quality companies with decent prospects. One of them is BeiGene BGNE, -1.64% which I first suggested in my letter at $28 in February 2016. It was up 685% by June 2018. And even in the biotech rout it is still up 400%. (My current buy limit is $100, give or take a little.) Another of mine in the Loncar ETF is the small-cap CASI Pharmaceuticals CASI, +5.31% This one advanced 270% after I suggested it in the low $2 range in early November 2017. I recently reiterated it because it looks attractive again in the pullback below $4.The Loncar China BioPharma ETF gives you access to plenty more potential China biotech winners like these, but it has one shortcoming, at least for now. Volume and liquidity are low, which means the bid-ask spread is wide. One way around this is to put in a limit buy order near the bid, and camp out until it gets hit.Besides an expected truce in the war on trade with China, which will soon put a bid under Chinese stocks again, here are four other reasons why it makes sense to invest in Chinese biotech for the long haul.1. The government really wants the sector to winUntil recently, China had no biotech or pharma sector speak of. Most pharma companies either developed generic drugs or manufactured drugs. “They didn’t do innovation or create new drugs, but that is changing dramatically overnight,” says Loncar. Biotech is a key part of the country’s efforts to spur continued growth by developing more sophisticated companies.2. The Hong Kong exchange now welcomes revenue-light businesses from China“That basically describes 99% of biotech companies,” Loncar, because they tend to be early-stage, developing businesses. The Hong Kong change is “huge” for China’s biotech sector, says Loncar, because it gives venture-capital firms an easier way to exit investments to realize gains, and put the money into start-ups. “That is super-important because it creates an ecosystem for investing in biotech for the first time,” says Loncar.3. China FDA upgradeChina has completely revamped its version of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to bring it up to global standards, says Loncar. This improves the quality of the sector, and piques investor interest.4. U.S.-trained talent is returning homeMajor China companies including Tencent TCEHY, +3.44% Baidu BIDU, +1.62% and Alibaba BABA, +1.79% exist, in part, because Chinese nationals who studied in the U.S. and worked at U.S. companies like Google GOOG, +1.10%GOOGL, +0.60% Facebook FB, +0.34% and Amazon.com AMZN, +4.86% returned to China to work in tech start-ups.“A lot of Chinese professionals who were educated in the U.S. and worked at U.S. biotech companies are going home now and starting biotech companies,” says Loncar.Those four factors add up to a “perfect storm” that should create a solid biotech sector in the country over the next several years. If so, now is the time to buy in.Keep in mind that even if these stocks get a boost near term on signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks, this group will be volatile because U.S.-China tensions will persist for decades as the two great powers battle for global hegemony.But there may be some good news in this, too. Persistent trade tensions could increase China’s focus on developing its biotech sector, as a way to move away from reliance on trade for growth, says Loncar. “They’re going to have world-class biotech sector, I have no doubt about that.”At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

BIDU,11/30/18,"Sell U.S. Tech Stocks, Buy Emerging Markets, Says Rob Arnott",https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-u-s-tech-stocks-buy-emerging-markets-says-rob-arnott-1543516901,"Investors may be thrilled that U.S. stocks have rallied, pushing the S&P 500 to a 4.4% total return for the year, including dividends, as of the close on Wednesday. But the good times probably won’t last, according to Rob Arnott, founder of the investment research firm Research Affiliates and co-manager of funds such as Pimco All Asset All Authority (ticker: PAUAX).A value-oriented contrarian, Arnott has long warned that U.S. stocks look pricey. And he’s especially concerned now that a handful of big tech stocks are carrying the market on their shoulders.“U.S. stocks have gotten frothy and expensive,” Arnott told Barron’s in an interview. “The FAANG stocks, in particular, are priced for perfection. If they don’t reinforce the notion that they’ll be 10 times as large a decade from now, then they’re overpriced and will perform badly.”The FAANGs refer to Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Along with a few other big-tech stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Chinese internet firms Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU), they have become a huge source of market concentration and power: Their total equity value tops $4.2 trillion, and they have been fueling the market’s gains.“The seven or eight largest companies on the planet are all tech darlings,” says Arnott. “Is that a diversified roster of top tier companies? Hardly.”Arnott points out that U.S. stocks trade at 30 times earnings, based on the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE) from the last 10 years, a valuation measure developed by Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller. The CAPE ratio only topped 30 once in history, just before the dot-com collapse, he says.Emerging markets, by contrast, look like a screaming buy. They trade at a CAPE ratio of 13. Investors worry that declining currencies and commodity prices will keep emerging markets depressed, and that the trade war between the U.S. and China will continue to be a drag on growth.But Arnott views those fears as overblown. “Will the trade war materially change the trajectory of half the world’s gross domestic product over the next 10 years?” he asks. “The answer is no.You cannot have a bargain in the absence of bad news that could get worse before it gets better. If you can accept that, then you have an opportunity to get some very good deals.”Granted, investors in Pimco All Asset All Authority haven’t seen great returns. The fund is down about 7% this year, and its 10-year annualized return of 5% trails 90% of mutual funds in the moderate-target-risk category, according to Morningstar.Arnott points out that most funds in the category are typically anchored to a 60/40 mix of stocks and bonds. All Authority aims to be different, holding what he calls “third-pillar” assets that can protect investors in a bear market and should do well in an inflationary environment: commodities, Treasury-inflation protected securities, and real-estate investment trusts. He also likes “stealth inflation fighters” such as emerging-market stocks and bonds, and high-yield U.S. junk bonds.Moreover, the fund is typically short the U.S. stock market, betting it will go down. “We actually have to love U.S. stocks in order to go above 0% in net U.S. stock exposure in All Authority,” he wrote in an email to Barron’s. Not surprisingly, he added, our returns “are in line with our home-base third pillar markets.”Those markets had an average return of 0.8% over the last five years. “That’s why our return lagged US stock-centric approaches—not because we’ve had an increasingly cautious view on U.S. equities,” he said.Still, it has been a painful slog for investors who have stuck with the fund while U.S. stocks have climbed, rising at a 14% annualized gain over the last decade, based on returns for the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY).“All Authority’s home base–away from mainstream stocks and bonds–will reliably lead to underperformance in a bull market,” Arnott tells Barron’s. “That’s what diversification does in a bull market.” At the end of what is now the longest bull market in history, he adds, “this is not a time to worry about the drag imposed by diversifying asset classes. “Indeed, Arnott sees a good chance that markets will start moving in his favor: He pegs the odds of a bear market breaking out in the U.S. in the near term at 40%. Investors might do well in a fund without much correlation to U.S. stocks in that scenario, though as he acknowledges, they may have to wait for their patience to be rewarded.“Do I have high confidence that the asset classes we focus on will beat U.S. stocks next year? No,” he says. “But I have high confidence they’ll win over a 10-year horizon.”Write to Daren Fonda at daren.fonda@barrons.com"

Don’t roll your eyes.We know it may not be a surprise, as utility companies offer investors a haven in times of turbulence. But what may interest you is how much better this stodgy sector’s performance has been over long periods.From the end of September, the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.09%  has declined 8%, including reinvested dividends, while the S&P 500 utilities sector returned a positive 3.3%. Here’s a chart showing how well the 12 sectors of the S&P 500 Index have fared over various periods:The S&P 500 utilities sector has been the best during the post-September market turmoil and has ranked second for 2018 through Nov. 26. But if you look at the longer periods, the total returns exceed those of the entire S&P 500 for all periods except for 10 years.But that 10-year figure is a bit deceptive. You need to consider what occurred before this 10-year period began. The S&P 500 was down 34% (including reinvested dividends) for two years through Nov. 26, 2008, while the utilities sector suffered a far milder 13% decline.The 20-year chart shows that, for the most part, the utilities sector has had less “downside capture” than the index:There’s no question that over the past five years, the information-technology sector, driven by the market-cap-weighted performance of the FAANG companies (Facebook FB, +0.34% Apple AAPL, +3.49% Amazon AMZN, +4.86% Netflix NFLX, +1.46%  and Alphabet GOOG, +1.10% ), has been the place to be. But the FAANG stocks have all fared even worse than the S&P 500 since the end of September, despite the companies’ fast growth.The 15-year and 20-year returns give evidence to the importance of the utilities sector: People and companies need those services in what is a critical industry protected by regulators. Utilities also reward investors with steady dividend payouts.Concentrating on individual stocks can be a risky endeavor. Shares of PG&E Corp. PCG, +2.77% the owner of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., are down 47% for 2018. Investors have worried that the company may be held liable for the California wildfires. Then again, some investors have looked at the decline as an opportunity.Regardless of how the PG&E saga plays out, there’s no question that a safer way for investors to gain exposure to the utilities sector is through an exchange traded fund, such as the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLU, +1.01%  the Vanguard Utilities ETF  VPU, +0.86%   or the iShares U.S. Utilities ETF  IDU, +0.95%Here are all 29 stocks included in the S&P 500 utilities sector, ranked by how well they have performed over the past five years:You can click on the tickers for more about each company, including news, profiles, charts, ratings and financials.Don’t miss: These stocks are in bear territory, but analysts expect them to roar backCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn’s Deep Dive columns here.Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

FB,12/01/18,Facebook Is Under Fire Again. Here’s What Could Come Next.,https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebook-is-under-fire-again-why-any-change-may-start-with-washington-1543662000,"Facebook has been here before: a scandal over its business practices, its executives under fire, and the specter of regulation being raised.This time, it is revelations about the hiring of an opposition research firm to go after critics of Facebook, as well as signs of possible tensions between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his No. 2, Sheryl Sandberg. (Zuckerberg has said that neither he nor Sandberg are going anywhere.)The recent headlines have come on top of concerns about user privacy and Russian influence over U.S. politics; shares of Facebook (ticker: FB) are now down 35% since its July 2018 high of $217.50, closing on Friday at $140.61. Yet as Barron’s has noted, for now, Facebook looks cheap in light of revenue gains that are forecast to double over the next four years.It is akin to a “sin stock,” and investors have cut the multiple significantly, but there remains a risk that the company’s prospects may be damaged more than the market expects down the road by Washington and Brussels.When might there be a reckoning? And will Facebook change?If there are to be changes, the catalyst may come next month, when Democrats take control of the House of Representatives. At a minimum, additional hearings that focus on Facebook are a strong possibility. That presents a relatively low risk to Facebook: Having its executives berated for a few hours may be nothing more than a form of penance.Still, a number of Democrats were frustrated by what they saw as a lack of seriousness in earlier, Republican-led hearings. Now, some are pushing for changes. As one congressional staff member told Barron’s, if an oil company keeps having oil spills, you can’t just say sorry and move on.Facebook has repeatedly tried to contain the damaging revelations of the past few weeks, including having senior executives makes calls to top Democrats, a person familiar with the matter says.But that effort may be a form of fighting the last battle. Lawmakers are already focusing on something that may pose a much longer-term burden on the company. Work has begun behind the scenes on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee to write legislation to address Facebook’s concentrated economic power through privacy and pro-competition measures, the person familiar with the matter says.“The past two years have exposed the dark side of technology, and Facebook is at the center of that problem,” says Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat.Interest in regulation that would protect privacy is bipartisan. At an oversight hearing of the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said that big tech companies are “no longer entitled to say to America—trust us; big tech is no longer entitled to that trust.”In the same hearing, Sen. Jerry Moran, the Kansas Republican who chairs the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science, agreed that the U.S. needs a federal privacy law.Republicans still hold the Senate, to be sure, yet with control of the House, Democrats set the agenda of critical committees like Energy and Commerce, and Judiciary, whose purview includes issues like data privacy and antitrust legislation.Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat who is the incoming chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, clashed with Zuckerberg on privacy during testimony over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and Rhode Island Democrat Rep. David Cicilline, the incoming chairman of the Judiciary’s Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law has been outspoken in his criticism of Facebook’s concentrated economic power.At the same time, political pressure on Facebook persists abroad.In a parliamentary hearing in London on Tuesday, lawmakers from Britain, Ireland, Canada, Brazil, France, Belgium, Argentina, Latvia, and Singapore convened to question Facebook executives over a series of scandals, including how the company handled an investigation into Russian manipulation of its users and its failure to police misuse of data by political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.Charlie Angus, vice chairman of Canada’s House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy, and Ethics, suggested at the hearing that the “simplest” way to better hold Facebook to account would be by breaking it up or treating it as a utility.“We’ve never seen anything quite like Facebook, where, while we were playing on our phones and apps, our democratic institutions…seem to have been upended by frat boy billionaires from California,” he said.Richard Allan, Zuckerberg’s representative at the hearing and the company’s vice president of policy solutions, said that Facebook was open to “the right kind of regulation,” before conceding, “I’m not going to disagree with you that we have damaged public trust with some of the actions we have taken.”Facebook has also come under fire over its hiring of Definers Public Affairs to do campaign-like opposition research on its critics. (Facebook has now dropped the firm.) On Thursday, the New York Times reported that Sandberg, the chief operating officer, asked Facebook’s communications staff to examine George Soros’s finances. The reports and what some inside Facebook describe as a sharp-elbowed management style have led to speculation that Sandberg could be forced out.“It is well past time for Sandberg to go,” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale School of Management. He also argues that Zuckerberg—who controls 60% of Facebook—should step back as chairman while remaining CEO.Facebook declined to comment for this article. It also would not make Sandberg or other executives available.While such a shake-up seems unlikely today, Facebook may make some minor changes to internal processes as it has in the past to stave off additional regulation and oversight, says Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities. It could, he says, appoint a chief ethics officer.Such moves, however, may not be enough to squelch talk of a more radical idea: break up Facebook.In a new book, The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age, Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, details how Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram demonstrates its overweening market power.“Instead of surrendering to the inevitable”—that Instagram would keep growing and pose a major competitive challenge—“Facebook realized it could just buy out the new,” he says.Indeed, as Matt Stoller, the policy director at the Open Markets Institute, notes, “When people talk about breaking up companies, they ask things like, ‘Well, how would you even do that?’ With Facebook, the answer is easy. You know how they bought Instagram? Undo that. It’s easy. They’re separate divisions; they’re separate products.”Some executives have already broken up with Facebook. The founders of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus have departed this year. Several top executives have also left.Lower in the ranks, Facebook employees have done some soul searching. A little more than half (52%) are optimistic about its future, down from 84% in 2017, according to results of an internal poll of employee attitudes shared by a Facebook employee with Barron’s. Only 53% believe that Facebook is “making the world better,” compared with 72% a year ago.A broader category of how they see the company—favorability—came in with a 70% rating, about the same as a year ago.Interviews with a handful of current and former Facebook employees portray a rank-and-file grappling during a difficult period.While some acknowledge the need for regulation, others believe that Facebook has taken necessary steps such as more personal content in news feeds and investments in safety and security.Still, “Facebook is no longer considered a supercool company,” says Paul Freiberger, president of Shimmering Careers in San Mateo, Calif., a career-coaching service.“They need that reputation to get top-level talent, but younger people are really annoyed by the reputation of the company.”Some asset managers are also annoyed, saying that Facebook is much slower to talk with investors than other big corporations.There are few signs that change will come from Facebook’s board, which includes such tech luminaries as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.Sonnenfeld, the Yale professor, says the board shares a “tribal mentality with Silicon Valley that resents anyone from the outside telling them what to do.”He adds, “That is one major pathology of the board. Instead of oversight, they think their role is to protect, like an offensive line in football. Facebook will do what it always does: dig in its heels and not change.”—Lucy McNulty contributed reporting from London.Write to Jon Swartz at Jon.Swartz@barrons.com and Ben Walsh at Ben.Walsh@barrons.com."

FB,11/30/18,"Chinese biotech stocks hit by a double whammy, which means it’s time to buy",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-biotech-stocks-hit-by-a-double-whammy-which-means-its-time-to-buy-2018-11-30,"Have investors hit peak negativity on China-based companies? I think there’s a good chance they have. If so, it’s time to buy China stocks, especially in biotechnology.Chinese biotech stocks have been particularly hammered because they are getting hit by a double whammy. They’re down because investors are overly negative on China due to trade-war tensions. And unlike the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.09% the U.S. biotech sector is actually already in a bear market. The SPDR S&P Biotech exchange traded fund XBI, +3.65% was recently down 25% from its summer highs.I’ll tell you the best way to buy China biotech stocks — and it is surprisingly easy. But first let’s look at why the worries behind the selloff in China stocks and biotech in general are overblown.On China fears, it’s key to keep in mind that President Donald Trump’s negotiating style is to start with bluster (which spooks investors) and then dial back to compromise to be able to boast about a “deal.”That’s going to be the case with China trade. One reason is that, near term, neither country can stand — or deserves — the pain that comes from a harsh trade regime.U.S. companies have extensive supply chains winding through China, which will be hard and costly to replace. U.S. consumers enjoy the cheap, yet high-quality, goods that come out of China — everything from guitars to Apple AAPL, +3.49%  iPhones. China needs U.S. markets and access to U.S. business partnerships, and university slots for students.So we’re going to see signs of progress on China trade talks and probably soon — at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Nov. 30 through Dec. 1.“The majority of clients believe there will be a truce, meaning there will be an agreement to resume negotiations and there will be no increase in tariffs over that period,” says John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy at J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.94%Even if we don’t get any signs of progress on China trade tensions, it never made sense that China biotech stocks should get hit by this war on trade. After all, who would hold human lives hostage to politics?On the biotech weakness, the key thing to remember here is that the selloff has little to do with sector trends, says Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee. It’s more about investors fleeing a high-beta group in a risk-off environment. When investor confidence returns, which is likely because there’s no looming recession and because the Fed will probably soon signal it’s reducing the number of planned rate hikes, high-beta groups like biotech will be among the best performers. China biotech stocks look like a great way to position for this kind of move, given the double whammy at work.But how to get access? Here you’re in luck. For the past few years biotech expert Brad Loncar has been travelling to China to meet with biotech companies and study which ones to put in a China biotech index he’s devised. Now there’s a an ETF based on that index. It’s called the Loncar China BioPharma ETF CHNA, +1.70%Loncar got a big break in this effort when Hong Kong recently loosened listing standards for companies, in that they’re no longer required to show revenue. This opened the door to listings of China biotech companies on the Hong Kong exchange. That’s a good thing for investors, because the Hong Kong exchange has fairly stringent listing standards. Mistakes will get through, but this generally means investors are less likely to buy into a fraud when they buy a Hong Kong-listed China biotech stock.The Loncar China BioPharma ETF gives you easy access to 28 biotech companies. Based on a small sampling of this group that I’ve studied and suggested in my stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks, these are quality companies with decent prospects. One of them is BeiGene BGNE, -1.64% which I first suggested in my letter at $28 in February 2016. It was up 685% by June 2018. And even in the biotech rout it is still up 400%. (My current buy limit is $100, give or take a little.) Another of mine in the Loncar ETF is the small-cap CASI Pharmaceuticals CASI, +5.31% This one advanced 270% after I suggested it in the low $2 range in early November 2017. I recently reiterated it because it looks attractive again in the pullback below $4.The Loncar China BioPharma ETF gives you access to plenty more potential China biotech winners like these, but it has one shortcoming, at least for now. Volume and liquidity are low, which means the bid-ask spread is wide. One way around this is to put in a limit buy order near the bid, and camp out until it gets hit.Besides an expected truce in the war on trade with China, which will soon put a bid under Chinese stocks again, here are four other reasons why it makes sense to invest in Chinese biotech for the long haul.1. The government really wants the sector to winUntil recently, China had no biotech or pharma sector speak of. Most pharma companies either developed generic drugs or manufactured drugs. “They didn’t do innovation or create new drugs, but that is changing dramatically overnight,” says Loncar. Biotech is a key part of the country’s efforts to spur continued growth by developing more sophisticated companies.2. The Hong Kong exchange now welcomes revenue-light businesses from China“That basically describes 99% of biotech companies,” Loncar, because they tend to be early-stage, developing businesses. The Hong Kong change is “huge” for China’s biotech sector, says Loncar, because it gives venture-capital firms an easier way to exit investments to realize gains, and put the money into start-ups. “That is super-important because it creates an ecosystem for investing in biotech for the first time,” says Loncar.3. China FDA upgradeChina has completely revamped its version of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to bring it up to global standards, says Loncar. This improves the quality of the sector, and piques investor interest.4. U.S.-trained talent is returning homeMajor China companies including Tencent TCEHY, +3.44% Baidu BIDU, +1.62% and Alibaba BABA, +1.79% exist, in part, because Chinese nationals who studied in the U.S. and worked at U.S. companies like Google GOOG, +1.10%GOOGL, +0.60% Facebook FB, +0.34% and Amazon.com AMZN, +4.86% returned to China to work in tech start-ups.“A lot of Chinese professionals who were educated in the U.S. and worked at U.S. biotech companies are going home now and starting biotech companies,” says Loncar.Those four factors add up to a “perfect storm” that should create a solid biotech sector in the country over the next several years. If so, now is the time to buy in.Keep in mind that even if these stocks get a boost near term on signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks, this group will be volatile because U.S.-China tensions will persist for decades as the two great powers battle for global hegemony.But there may be some good news in this, too. Persistent trade tensions could increase China’s focus on developing its biotech sector, as a way to move away from reliance on trade for growth, says Loncar. “They’re going to have world-class biotech sector, I have no doubt about that.”At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

FB,11/30/18,"Sell U.S. Tech Stocks, Buy Emerging Markets, Says Rob Arnott",https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-u-s-tech-stocks-buy-emerging-markets-says-rob-arnott-1543516901,"Investors may be thrilled that U.S. stocks have rallied, pushing the S&P 500 to a 4.4% total return for the year, including dividends, as of the close on Wednesday. But the good times probably won’t last, according to Rob Arnott, founder of the investment research firm Research Affiliates and co-manager of funds such as Pimco All Asset All Authority (ticker: PAUAX).A value-oriented contrarian, Arnott has long warned that U.S. stocks look pricey. And he’s especially concerned now that a handful of big tech stocks are carrying the market on their shoulders.“U.S. stocks have gotten frothy and expensive,” Arnott told Barron’s in an interview. “The FAANG stocks, in particular, are priced for perfection. If they don’t reinforce the notion that they’ll be 10 times as large a decade from now, then they’re overpriced and will perform badly.”The FAANGs refer to Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Along with a few other big-tech stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Chinese internet firms Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU), they have become a huge source of market concentration and power: Their total equity value tops $4.2 trillion, and they have been fueling the market’s gains.“The seven or eight largest companies on the planet are all tech darlings,” says Arnott. “Is that a diversified roster of top tier companies? Hardly.”Arnott points out that U.S. stocks trade at 30 times earnings, based on the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE) from the last 10 years, a valuation measure developed by Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller. The CAPE ratio only topped 30 once in history, just before the dot-com collapse, he says.Emerging markets, by contrast, look like a screaming buy. They trade at a CAPE ratio of 13. Investors worry that declining currencies and commodity prices will keep emerging markets depressed, and that the trade war between the U.S. and China will continue to be a drag on growth.But Arnott views those fears as overblown. “Will the trade war materially change the trajectory of half the world’s gross domestic product over the next 10 years?” he asks. “The answer is no.You cannot have a bargain in the absence of bad news that could get worse before it gets better. If you can accept that, then you have an opportunity to get some very good deals.”Granted, investors in Pimco All Asset All Authority haven’t seen great returns. The fund is down about 7% this year, and its 10-year annualized return of 5% trails 90% of mutual funds in the moderate-target-risk category, according to Morningstar.Arnott points out that most funds in the category are typically anchored to a 60/40 mix of stocks and bonds. All Authority aims to be different, holding what he calls “third-pillar” assets that can protect investors in a bear market and should do well in an inflationary environment: commodities, Treasury-inflation protected securities, and real-estate investment trusts. He also likes “stealth inflation fighters” such as emerging-market stocks and bonds, and high-yield U.S. junk bonds.Moreover, the fund is typically short the U.S. stock market, betting it will go down. “We actually have to love U.S. stocks in order to go above 0% in net U.S. stock exposure in All Authority,” he wrote in an email to Barron’s. Not surprisingly, he added, our returns “are in line with our home-base third pillar markets.”Those markets had an average return of 0.8% over the last five years. “That’s why our return lagged US stock-centric approaches—not because we’ve had an increasingly cautious view on U.S. equities,” he said.Still, it has been a painful slog for investors who have stuck with the fund while U.S. stocks have climbed, rising at a 14% annualized gain over the last decade, based on returns for the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY).“All Authority’s home base–away from mainstream stocks and bonds–will reliably lead to underperformance in a bull market,” Arnott tells Barron’s. “That’s what diversification does in a bull market.” At the end of what is now the longest bull market in history, he adds, “this is not a time to worry about the drag imposed by diversifying asset classes. “Indeed, Arnott sees a good chance that markets will start moving in his favor: He pegs the odds of a bear market breaking out in the U.S. in the near term at 40%. Investors might do well in a fund without much correlation to U.S. stocks in that scenario, though as he acknowledges, they may have to wait for their patience to be rewarded.“Do I have high confidence that the asset classes we focus on will beat U.S. stocks next year? No,” he says. “But I have high confidence they’ll win over a 10-year horizon.”Write to Daren Fonda at daren.fonda@barrons.com"
FB,11/30/18,Hedge Funds Were Selling FAANG Stocks Before They Sank,https://www.barrons.com/articles/hedge-funds-were-selling-faang-stocks-before-they-sank-1543597324,"FAANG stocks have had one of their worst routs in recent months, with all of the them dipping into bear-market levels at some point–meaning share prices plunging 20% or more from the latest peak.Some hedge funds might have avoided part of that damage by selling the FAANGs early enough.In the third quarter, hedge funds sold over $34 billion in stocks–about 2% of their total assets, Jefferies strategist Steven DeSanctis writes in a Friday research report.It’s worth noting that the S&P 500 did not start dropping until Oct. 3; but hedge funds were already reducing weight in stocks throughout the third quarter in anticipation of higher risks and a trend change in the equity market.More noticeable was the sharp decline in their FAANG exposure. Hedge-fund managers reduced 14.6% of their FAANG holdings in the third quarter. Facebook (FB), whose shares are now 36.2% down from a July peak, saw hedge funds cut their holdings in the social network by 28%–a whopping $7.5 billion.Hedge funds were getting rid of FAANG stock before they slid. During the third quarter, while Facebook tumbled 16.7% and Netflix (NFLX) lost 6.0%, the other three FAANGs– Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon.com (AMZN)–made gains. The FAANG stocks topped out at different times this summer, Barron’s noted.DeSanctis thinks hedge funds might be selling for another reason too: They were trying to raise more cash in preparation for next year’s redemption. Hedge-fund performance has been weak throughout 2018, even when compared with exchange-traded and mutual funds. Some managers might be anticipating more redemption from investors in 2019 and getting ready with their cash flow, writes DeSanctis.Whatever the reason, hedge funds’ shedding of FAANG stock has certainly contributed to the further turmoil for the group in October and November. In the fourth quarter so far through Thursday, all FAANGs were in negative territory, with losses ranging from 9.0% to 24.3%.“If this [hedge-fund] money comes back to the market, it potentially provides some fuel for a nice rally,” writes DeSanctis.Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com"

FB,11/30/18,The Stock Market Keeps Forming a ‘Death Cross.’ What’s That?,https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-is-a-stock-market-death-cross-1543525351,"You’ve probably seen the word “death cross” a lot in the financial media lately. While the name itself sounds ominous enough, it’s important to understand what it is exactly, why people care about it—and why you shouldn’t panic when it happens.A death cross is a chart pattern that appears when a stock’s short-term moving average—meaning the average price over a certain time period—crosses below its long-term moving average. There is no fixed rule about what time frame to look at, but many define it as the crossover of the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average.A death cross is viewed by technical analysts as a signal that a major downturn is coming, as it suggests the short-term momentum in the underlying asset is slowing down enough and graduating into a long-term downtrend.To be sure, a death cross is usually not the earliest sign of a downtrend, but rather often confirms a pullback that’s been in place for a while. Investors concerned about bear markets often view the death cross as a timing signal to get out and lock in the gains before everything turns ugly. Hence, a death cross accompanied by high trading volume is considered especially significant, since that means people are starting to panic and sell.This year has seen no shortage of death crosses. A group of stocks, indexes, and asset classes have seen such a move. That incudes Facebook in April; gold in June; the Russell 2000on Nov. 13; Alphabeton Nov. 15; Netflix on Nov. 19; crude oil on Nov. 23; and the Nasdaq Composite on Nov. 26. Even the S&P 500came close to forming a death cross—twice.So does a death cross really bring about death? Not necessarily.First of all, a death cross is only so meaningful when both the short-term and long-term moving averages are declining. If the short-term line is falling but the long-term line is still going up, that’s not as concerning.Since 1928, the S&P 500 has experienced 12 “true” death crosses when both moving averages were going down, according to Bespoke Investment Group’s George Pearkes. The index declined 83% of the time in the month following those occurrences, with a median decline of 3.1%. But during the subsequent six months, stocks were actually positive 83% of the time, returning a median gain of 9.8%.“While a death cross doesn’t necessarily spell the death of secular gains for equities, they have historically been a relatively bad sign for near-term equity returns.” Pearkes wrote in a recent note.In fact, death crosses have become more common. Out of the 12 death crosses in the history of the S&P 500, four have occurred in this current bull market.“The fact that we haven’t seen a bear market following 4 separate instances of a death cross since 2010 is a good example of why ‘death’ might be a slight exaggeration!” Pearkes said.Indeed, investors who fled the market out of fear of the death cross missed sizable gains that came along later. Those who bought the dip gained handsomely in the following years.So a death cross might not be as fatal as it sounds. Instead, investors should treat it as just one of the alarming signs—among many others—they should watch for.Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com"

FB,11/29/18,There’s More Than One Way to Be a Value Investor,https://www.barrons.com/articles/theres-more-than-one-way-to-be-a-value-investor-1543485600,"During the market’s recent tumble, the outperformance of value stocks—the market’s cheapest—has led to talks about a revival of the out-of-favor group. But there’s more than one right way to be a value investor.In fact, there are many ways to measure whether a stock is cheap or not. Some of the most common metrics include price/earnings, price-to-book, and price-to-cash-flow ratios. The Russell 1000 Value index, the most widely watched value benchmark, uses price/book, while many prefer the ease of price/earnings.So which should an investor use? It depends on the sector, says Sara Shores, head of factor-based investment strategy at BlackRock. “If a U.S. technology stock is more expensive than a German bank, you wouldn’t expect it to be an apple-to-apple comparison,” she explains. “What is relevant is different by industry, [and] that certainly increases the complexity of the exercise.”Price-to-cash flow might be a good way to judge Boeing (ticker: BA), for example, but it isn’t really applicable to banks. The reason: The ratio captures only cash generated from business operations, while banks make most of their money from financing activities.And while price-to-book (or price-to-tangible book) works well for banks, it doesn’t work for companies with a lot of intangible assets like technology, patents, and brand reputation.“If you’re a car manufacturer, [and] you can well capture the valuation through property, land, and equipment, book-to-price might be great,” says Shores. “But if you are Facebook (FB), what does the book value of that company even mean?”So which metric should investors use? Morgan Stanley’s Brian Hayes and his team backtested 14 value metrics across 44 industries to see which offered the best returns and lowest volatility over the long run.When rebalanced once a year, cash-flow-related metrics were most effective in over 40% of the studied industries, including hotels, health-care providers, and household products. Despite its efficacy, however, among major value indexes in the U.S., only the MSCI USA Enhanced Value index included “enterprise value-to-cash flow from operations” in its methodology.“It’s not widely used probably because of the trickiness of applying it,” says Aye Soe, managing director of research and design at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Although cash-flow-driven strategies have earned a fairly good long-term premium in S&P Global’s research, they require a lot of nuanced decisions, Soe told Barron’s. Some complications include what to do when the cash flow is negative, or whether to use cash flow, free cash flow, or leveraged cash flow.Earnings-related metrics are the best measurement for about 30% of industries, including insurance and logistics. Price-to-book, despite being the cornerstone of value investing, is the top choice for only 7% of industries, including banks and telecom companies.The dynamic also changes depending on the time frame and how often a portfolio is rebalanced. Hayes’ research found that valuation metrics perform nearly as well at three-month rebalancing as they do at one-month rebalancing, but performance declines notably if the portfolio is only rebalanced annually.Finding the balance between a strategy’s effectiveness and its transaction cost can be key to the return difference. “For most industries, there is little motivation (once transaction costs are considered) to rebalance valuation-driven portfolios monthly,” recommends Hayes in the report.Most value-focused exchange-traded funds on the market don’t offer industry-specific stock selection, but for investors interested in getting their hands dirty, it might be worth the effort.Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com"

FB,11/28/18,These 2 shocks will jolt stocks higher — and 15 smart ways to prepare for that move,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-2-shocks-will-jolt-stocks-higher-and-15-smart-ways-to-prepare-for-that-move-2018-11-28,"Investor sentiment has now fallen prey to the stock-market equivalent of cardiac arrest.That’s understandable. Popular stocks like Amazon.com AMZN, +4.86% Apple AAPL, +3.49%  and Facebook FB, +0.34% are all in bear-market territory. So are broad sector indexes like the Vanguard Energy exchange-traded fund VDE, +2.52% the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF XBI, +3.65%  and SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF XHB, +1.58%Sentiment is now so dead that it suggests the next leg of the stock market is up, in the contrarian sense.Consider the ratio of open interest in puts (a negative bet) to calls (a more hopeful position). This ratio has spiked to levels frequently followed by rallies, says Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group. “That would support my call for a possible bounce into year-end,” he says.Insiders, the people with the front-row seats on business confirm they expect the next major move is up. Insiders are bullish overall with purchases outweighing sales — an unusual tilt for them. They usually sell more stock than they buy.In analysis I do of insider activity for my stock newsletter Brush Up on Stocks, I’ve noticed that insiders are now particularly bullish in cyclical sectors like auto parts, home building and related retailers, real estate, chemicals and energy. This makes sense. Cyclical stocks are among those that have been hit the hardest. So they’re likely to rebound the most in a market reversal.Of course for markets to firm up again, something is going to have to jolt investor sentiment out of cardiac arrest and bring it back to life. Here are the two chest paddles that will soon provide the shocks that investor sentiment needs.Throughout this recovery since 2009 every time the Federal Reserve has started to pull away the comforter of low interest rates, investors have thrown a temper tantrum until the Fed backs off. That’s what investors are doing now, and expect the standard Fed response to soon happen again.This isn’t just about soothing spoiled stock investors. There are good reasons to be worried about the aggressive Fed rate hike path given many clear signs of a slowdown in the U.S. and throughout the world. Global purchasing managers indexes are rolling over. Leading economic indicators like home prices, automobile sales, oil prices and commodity prices are weakening.“We’re seeing swiftest deterioration in the global economic data in three years,” says Larry McDonald of The Bear Traps Report. “The trends in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and China are all pointing towards an upcoming global recession.”Bond markets confirm trouble ahead. The spread between yields on high-yield bonds and 10-year U.S. Treasurys TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.25% is widening.Read: Trump again lashes out at Powell, says he’s ‘not even a little bit happy’ about naming him Fed chiefThe upshot in all of this: “The U.S. equity market will crash in 1987 style if the Fed plays tough guy. It’s that simple,” says McDonald. He thinks U.S. stocks could fall another 40% in this scenario. This risk will make the Fed back away from its proposed course of aggressive rate hikes in 2019.“The Fed will have no choice but to pause on their policy path if they want to delay the end of the current economic expansion,” says McDonald. Central banks around the world will follow suit. We just saw signs of this in dovish comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. “We see these comments as just the beginning of a wave of central bank talk that will shift dovish and move markets,” says McDonald.Read: Seemingly dovish, Powell says interest rates are ‘just below’ level where they won’t stimulate economyThe counter argument here is that it’s not the Fed’s job to manage the stock market. But this view is off target. At some point, the dramatic wealth destruction of a sharp market decline darkens outlooks so much that it reduces investment, which hurts growth. Investor fear also raises borrowing costs as it drives up bond yields. So calming investor fear to keep the expansion going is logically part of the Fed’s job. Besides, the stock market is one of the best leading economic indicators, so the big pullback is a negative signal on growth. Fix worries about growth, and stocks recover.Don’t be mislead by strong third-quarter growth. That’s history and the markets are forward-looking. Besides, it was an anomaly based on one-offs like inventory building ahead of trade tariffs as well as the impact of tax cuts and fiscal stimulus.Read: Economy grew 3.5% in third quarter, pushes corporate profits to 6-year high, GDP showsThe economies of both China and the U.S. are now suffering due to the war on trade. This puts pressure on both President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to do something about it, and they will. “They’re staring down the barrel of an ugly global recession. President Trump and Xi know they must do a deal,” says McDonald.Yes, Trump just reiterated a desire to impose tariffs on Chinese goods. But McDonald views this as “hardball” ahead of the Group of 20 (G-20) summit this week in Argentina, where Trump and Xi will meet. Signs of progress here could boost U.S. stocks.Read: Here are 4 routes to defuse U.S.-China tensionsInsiders heavily favor cyclical names right now, and that’s one way to go.

But during a market correction, there will be more of those, and you may find opportunities to scoop up bargains for extra profits when the broader market rebounds.In mid-October, data provided by FactSet showed that exactly half of the stocks included in the S&P 500 Index were down at least 20% from their all-time highs. With the market pulling back since then, it might be interesting to use more recent data to see which ones have declined the most from their 52-week highs.A bear market for an index or an individual stock is usually defined as a 20%-plus decline. At about 11:10 a.m. ET on Nov. 26, 206 stocks among the S&P 500 were down at least 20% from their 52-week highs. That’s a huge list, but it might be of interest to see which of the companies in bear territory are favored the most among Wall Street analysts, whose research is used by their broker colleagues to help push stock purchases.The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.13%  fell 10% from its intraday high on Oct. 3 through its intraday low on Nov. 23. The S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.09%  was down 10.5% from its intraday high on Sept. 21 through its intraday low on Nov. 23. Both benchmark indices had suffered corrections earlier in 2018. The Dow ended on Nov. 23 down 1.8% for the year, while the S&P 500 was down 1.5%.The Dow was last in a bear market heading to the post-crisis low on March 9, 2009. But even though the financial media generally agree that the bull market has continued from that date, the S&P 500 on an intraday basis was in a bear market when it fell 20.2% from an intraday high on July 1, 2011, through its intraday low on Oct. 4, 2011, according to data supplied by FactSet.Starting with the 206 S&P 500 stocks in bear territory (from 52-week highs) through 11:10 a.m. ET on Nov. 26, we have narrowed the list to 22 companies that are covered by at least 10 analysts, with at least 80% of the analysts rating the shares a “buy” or equivalent, according to FactSet.Here they are, ranked by the percentage of buy ratings:Don’t miss: Here’s how to easily reduce your investment risk just at the right timeCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn’s Deep Dive columns here.Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

GDPR, which took effect in May, strictly delineates how companies may collect or process information about EU residents.The consumer groups said the search-engine giant collects location data on users of its apps through features and “does not give them straightforward information about what this effectively entails,” according to a statement issued by the European Consumer Organization, an umbrella group for national bodies across the continent. The groups say the practice violates “fundamental GDPR principles.”Separately in London, parliament members from an international committee representing nine countries questioned — at times angrily — Richard Allan, Facebook Inc.’s FB, +0.34%   vice president of policy solutions, about how the social network shares personal data and how it has fought misinformation. The company has apologized for what it said was inappropriate sharing of users’ data and a failure to move quickly enough to deter the circulation of fake news on its network.

Faster, it seems, than the writers at Saturday Night Live.SNL had some fun with the company’s multibillion-dollar programming strategy this weekend, running a mock commercial declaring that “In 2019, we’ll have even more programming to choose from because we’ve GONE CRAZY.”“We’re spending billions of dollars and making every show in the world,” the announcer said.Asked about the commercial during a UBS conference Monday, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos pointed out that South Park did it first, with a company executive answering the phone “Netflix, you’re greenlit.””The challenge [for] SNL is they’ve got to be funnier—and faster—than those guys,” Sarandos said, after joking that he would happily buy SNL’s mock series Leslie Jones in a Van Getting Batteries.Sarandos offered less-jocular insights a bit later as he responded to a question about how the company measures return on its content spending:We look at the incremental investment in content. And we look at it and say, “Look, at some point, you’re going to hit a point of diminishing returns on the investment,” meaning that we’re putting new money in and not getting any new watching out. And I think until we see that, I think that we’re enthused to push forward, meaning that we will keep investing more in programming.But we’re also getting more users and more hours of usage from our existing users. So, meaning, there’s a lot more growth, we think, and [we] continue to invest in more programming today. When we see those kind of inflection points to the business where that's no longer the case, then we could start looking at that.And the marginal cost of being wrong about it, by the way, meaning overinvesting in it, is not that high. So what you don’t want to do is pull back too fast and figure out that you were wrong, where the other one is you over invest by one marginal show or one incremental show that you may or may not have needed. I think that’s probably the right trade-off in the business.Shares of Netflix closed Monday up about 1.5% at around $290, leaving them up about 51% in 2018 after falling more than 22% in Q4.This story has been updated since it was first published to reflect closing prices.Email David Marino-Nachison at david.marino-nachison@barrons.com.

NFLX,12/01/18,Utility stocks have beaten the S&P 500 in two months of turbulence and in the long run,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/utility-stocks-have-beaten-the-sp-500-in-two-months-of-turbulence-and-in-the-long-run-2018-11-28,"The S&P 500 utilities sector has been the best performer during the market decline that began in October. Don’t roll your eyes.We know it may not be a surprise, as utility companies offer investors a haven in times of turbulence. But what may interest you is how much better this stodgy sector’s performance has been over long periods.From the end of September, the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.09%  has declined 8%, including reinvested dividends, while the S&P 500 utilities sector returned a positive 3.3%. Here’s a chart showing how well the 12 sectors of the S&P 500 Index have fared over various periods:The S&P 500 utilities sector has been the best during the post-September market turmoil and has ranked second for 2018 through Nov. 26. But if you look at the longer periods, the total returns exceed those of the entire S&P 500 for all periods except for 10 years.But that 10-year figure is a bit deceptive. You need to consider what occurred before this 10-year period began. The S&P 500 was down 34% (including reinvested dividends) for two years through Nov. 26, 2008, while the utilities sector suffered a far milder 13% decline.The 20-year chart shows that, for the most part, the utilities sector has had less “downside capture” than the index:There’s no question that over the past five years, the information-technology sector, driven by the market-cap-weighted performance of the FAANG companies (Facebook FB, +0.34% Apple AAPL, +3.49% Amazon AMZN, +4.86% Netflix NFLX, +1.46%  and Alphabet GOOG, +1.10% ), has been the place to be. But the FAANG stocks have all fared even worse than the S&P 500 since the end of September, despite the companies’ fast growth.The 15-year and 20-year returns give evidence to the importance of the utilities sector: People and companies need those services in what is a critical industry protected by regulators. Utilities also reward investors with steady dividend payouts.Concentrating on individual stocks can be a risky endeavor. Shares of PG&E Corp. PCG, +2.77% the owner of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., are down 47% for 2018. Investors have worried that the company may be held liable for the California wildfires. Then again, some investors have looked at the decline as an opportunity.Regardless of how the PG&E saga plays out, there’s no question that a safer way for investors to gain exposure to the utilities sector is through an exchange traded fund, such as the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLU, +1.01%  the Vanguard Utilities ETF  VPU, +0.86%   or the iShares U.S. Utilities ETF  IDU, +0.95%Here are all 29 stocks included in the S&P 500 utilities sector, ranked by how well they have performed over the past five years:You can click on the tickers for more about each company, including news, profiles, charts, ratings and financials.Don’t miss: These stocks are in bear territory, but analysts expect them to roar backCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn’s Deep Dive columns here.Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

NFLX,11/30/18,"Sell U.S. Tech Stocks, Buy Emerging Markets, Says Rob Arnott",https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-u-s-tech-stocks-buy-emerging-markets-says-rob-arnott-1543516901,"Investors may be thrilled that U.S. stocks have rallied, pushing the S&P 500 to a 4.4% total return for the year, including dividends, as of the close on Wednesday. But the good times probably won’t last, according to Rob Arnott, founder of the investment research firm Research Affiliates and co-manager of funds such as Pimco All Asset All Authority (ticker: PAUAX).A value-oriented contrarian, Arnott has long warned that U.S. stocks look pricey. And he’s especially concerned now that a handful of big tech stocks are carrying the market on their shoulders.“U.S. stocks have gotten frothy and expensive,” Arnott told Barron’s in an interview. “The FAANG stocks, in particular, are priced for perfection. If they don’t reinforce the notion that they’ll be 10 times as large a decade from now, then they’re overpriced and will perform badly.”The FAANGs refer to Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Along with a few other big-tech stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Chinese internet firms Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU), they have become a huge source of market concentration and power: Their total equity value tops $4.2 trillion, and they have been fueling the market’s gains.“The seven or eight largest companies on the planet are all tech darlings,” says Arnott. “Is that a diversified roster of top tier companies? Hardly.”Arnott points out that U.S. stocks trade at 30 times earnings, based on the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE) from the last 10 years, a valuation measure developed by Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller. The CAPE ratio only topped 30 once in history, just before the dot-com collapse, he says.Emerging markets, by contrast, look like a screaming buy. They trade at a CAPE ratio of 13. Investors worry that declining currencies and commodity prices will keep emerging markets depressed, and that the trade war between the U.S. and China will continue to be a drag on growth.But Arnott views those fears as overblown. “Will the trade war materially change the trajectory of half the world’s gross domestic product over the next 10 years?” he asks. “The answer is no.You cannot have a bargain in the absence of bad news that could get worse before it gets better. If you can accept that, then you have an opportunity to get some very good deals.”Granted, investors in Pimco All Asset All Authority haven’t seen great returns. The fund is down about 7% this year, and its 10-year annualized return of 5% trails 90% of mutual funds in the moderate-target-risk category, according to Morningstar.Arnott points out that most funds in the category are typically anchored to a 60/40 mix of stocks and bonds. All Authority aims to be different, holding what he calls “third-pillar” assets that can protect investors in a bear market and should do well in an inflationary environment: commodities, Treasury-inflation protected securities, and real-estate investment trusts. He also likes “stealth inflation fighters” such as emerging-market stocks and bonds, and high-yield U.S. junk bonds.Moreover, the fund is typically short the U.S. stock market, betting it will go down. “We actually have to love U.S. stocks in order to go above 0% in net U.S. stock exposure in All Authority,” he wrote in an email to Barron’s. Not surprisingly, he added, our returns “are in line with our home-base third pillar markets.”Those markets had an average return of 0.8% over the last five years. “That’s why our return lagged US stock-centric approaches—not because we’ve had an increasingly cautious view on U.S. equities,” he said.Still, it has been a painful slog for investors who have stuck with the fund while U.S. stocks have climbed, rising at a 14% annualized gain over the last decade, based on returns for the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY).“All Authority’s home base–away from mainstream stocks and bonds–will reliably lead to underperformance in a bull market,” Arnott tells Barron’s. “That’s what diversification does in a bull market.” At the end of what is now the longest bull market in history, he adds, “this is not a time to worry about the drag imposed by diversifying asset classes. “Indeed, Arnott sees a good chance that markets will start moving in his favor: He pegs the odds of a bear market breaking out in the U.S. in the near term at 40%. Investors might do well in a fund without much correlation to U.S. stocks in that scenario, though as he acknowledges, they may have to wait for their patience to be rewarded.“Do I have high confidence that the asset classes we focus on will beat U.S. stocks next year? No,” he says. “But I have high confidence they’ll win over a 10-year horizon.”Write to Daren Fonda at daren.fonda@barrons.com"
NFLX,11/30/18,Hedge Funds Were Selling FAANG Stocks Before They Sank,https://www.barrons.com/articles/hedge-funds-were-selling-faang-stocks-before-they-sank-1543597324,"FAANG stocks have had one of their worst routs in recent months, with all of the them dipping into bear-market levels at some point–meaning share prices plunging 20% or more from the latest peak.Some hedge funds might have avoided part of that damage by selling the FAANGs early enough.In the third quarter, hedge funds sold over $34 billion in stocks–about 2% of their total assets, Jefferies strategist Steven DeSanctis writes in a Friday research report.It’s worth noting that the S&P 500 did not start dropping until Oct. 3; but hedge funds were already reducing weight in stocks throughout the third quarter in anticipation of higher risks and a trend change in the equity market.More noticeable was the sharp decline in their FAANG exposure. Hedge-fund managers reduced 14.6% of their FAANG holdings in the third quarter. Facebook (FB), whose shares are now 36.2% down from a July peak, saw hedge funds cut their holdings in the social network by 28%–a whopping $7.5 billion.Hedge funds were getting rid of FAANG stock before they slid. During the third quarter, while Facebook tumbled 16.7% and Netflix (NFLX) lost 6.0%, the other three FAANGs– Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon.com (AMZN)–made gains. The FAANG stocks topped out at different times this summer, Barron’s noted.DeSanctis thinks hedge funds might be selling for another reason too: They were trying to raise more cash in preparation for next year’s redemption. Hedge-fund performance has been weak throughout 2018, even when compared with exchange-traded and mutual funds. Some managers might be anticipating more redemption from investors in 2019 and getting ready with their cash flow, writes DeSanctis.Whatever the reason, hedge funds’ shedding of FAANG stock has certainly contributed to the further turmoil for the group in October and November. In the fourth quarter so far through Thursday, all FAANGs were in negative territory, with losses ranging from 9.0% to 24.3%.“If this [hedge-fund] money comes back to the market, it potentially provides some fuel for a nice rally,” writes DeSanctis.Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com"
NFLX,11/30/18,"10 Stocks That Could Tank, According to Morgan Stanley",https://www.barrons.com/articles/morgan-stanley-says-these-stocks-could-tank-1543573800,"Stock analysts issue more flattery than flak. For each 10 positive ratings of companies in the S&P 500 index, there is only a single negative one, according to a Barron’s screen of FactSet data. So thumbs-down reports tend to stand out.For example, Morgan Stanley on Thursday published a list of its favorite “secular growth stocks,” which the firm’s analysts reckon can “grow strongly independent of global economic conditions.”There are some predictable names, like Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), and some picks that are less universally adored, like the biotech firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Assurant (AIZ), which sells, among other things, extended warranties for smartphones. But a companion list of “secularly challenged stocks” was perhaps more eye-catching.Listen to a conversation between Jack Hough and Alex Eule about what to do with Facebook’s unloved stock in a recent episode of The Readback. You can sign up for the podcast in iTunes or wherever you listen to podcasts.That list includes stocks rated Underweight by Morgan Stanley’s analysts, where the price target is near or below the recent share price. Risk and reward for each are skewed unfavorably, with potential downside in a bearish scenario exceeding potential upside in a bullish one. And for each, the analyst’s negative thesis rests on more than fleeting problems—things like rising competition or deteriorating end markets. Among 25 stocks on the list, the 10 listed below had bear cases that implied at least 60% downside from recent levels.Two important caveats: First, bear cases aren’t what the firm sees as the likeliest outcome for each stock. Base cases are, and those point to the price targets listed below. Second, struggling companies can produce big gains on good news, as illustrated Thursday by one company on the list. Abercrombie & Fitch stock closed up 21% after its third-quarter report suggested a strong start to the holiday shopping season.So consider the following a think-twice-before-buying list, in one firm’s view, and not a list of stocks to bet against. The price targets listed are Morgan Stanley’s base case, not the bear case.Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF)Morgan Stanley base case price target: $14Thursday’s closing price: $20.70Challenges include market share losses to fast-fashion, discount, and online retailers.Avis Budget Group (CAR)Morgan Stanley base case price target: $30Thursday’s closing price: $29.08Challenges include ride-hailing services, leverage, potential for decline in used car residual values.Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)Morgan Stanley base case price target: $13Thursday’s closing price: $12.78Challenges include rising competition from Wayfair,At Home, and mass merchants.EQT (EQT)Morgan Stanley base case price target: $12Thursday’s closing price: $18.80Challenges include high cost structure, risk to natural gas production growth.Fitbit (FIT)Morgan Stanley base case price target: $4Thursday’s closing price: $5.38Challenges include competition from Apple and Garmin, uncertainty over future product improvements.Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ)Morgan Stanley base case price target $15Thursday’s closing price: $18.65Challenges include ride-hailing services, leverage, potential for decline in used car residual values.Juniper Networks (JNPR)Morgan Stanley base case price target: $20Thursday’s closing price: $28.59Challenges include underinvestment versus peers in networking, and cybersecurity.MSG Networks (MSGN)Morgan Stanley base case price target: $23Thursday’s closing price: $27.58Challenges include rising sports rights costs, potential for subscriber erosion.Seaspan (SSW)Morgan Stanley base case price target: $5.50Thursday’s closing price: $9.65Challenges include leverage, expanding global fleet, trade friction.Tenneco (TEN)Morgan Stanley base case price target: $30Thursday’s closing price: $33.34Challenges include leverage, exposure to cyclical downturn in auto components, limited products for full-electric cars.Write to Jack Hough at jack.hough@barrons.com"
NFLX,11/30/18,The Stock Market Keeps Forming a ‘Death Cross.’ What’s That?,https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-is-a-stock-market-death-cross-1543525351,"You’ve probably seen the word “death cross” a lot in the financial media lately. While the name itself sounds ominous enough, it’s important to understand what it is exactly, why people care about it—and why you shouldn’t panic when it happens.A death cross is a chart pattern that appears when a stock’s short-term moving average—meaning the average price over a certain time period—crosses below its long-term moving average. There is no fixed rule about what time frame to look at, but many define it as the crossover of the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average.A death cross is viewed by technical analysts as a signal that a major downturn is coming, as it suggests the short-term momentum in the underlying asset is slowing down enough and graduating into a long-term downtrend.To be sure, a death cross is usually not the earliest sign of a downtrend, but rather often confirms a pullback that’s been in place for a while. Investors concerned about bear markets often view the death cross as a timing signal to get out and lock in the gains before everything turns ugly. Hence, a death cross accompanied by high trading volume is considered especially significant, since that means people are starting to panic and sell.This year has seen no shortage of death crosses. A group of stocks, indexes, and asset classes have seen such a move. That incudes Facebook in April; gold in June; the Russell 2000on Nov. 13; Alphabeton Nov. 15; Netflix on Nov. 19; crude oil on Nov. 23; and the Nasdaq Composite on Nov. 26. Even the S&P 500came close to forming a death cross—twice.So does a death cross really bring about death? Not necessarily.First of all, a death cross is only so meaningful when both the short-term and long-term moving averages are declining. If the short-term line is falling but the long-term line is still going up, that’s not as concerning.Since 1928, the S&P 500 has experienced 12 “true” death crosses when both moving averages were going down, according to Bespoke Investment Group’s George Pearkes. The index declined 83% of the time in the month following those occurrences, with a median decline of 3.1%. But during the subsequent six months, stocks were actually positive 83% of the time, returning a median gain of 9.8%.“While a death cross doesn’t necessarily spell the death of secular gains for equities, they have historically been a relatively bad sign for near-term equity returns.” Pearkes wrote in a recent note.In fact, death crosses have become more common. Out of the 12 death crosses in the history of the S&P 500, four have occurred in this current bull market.“The fact that we haven’t seen a bear market following 4 separate instances of a death cross since 2010 is a good example of why ‘death’ might be a slight exaggeration!” Pearkes said.Indeed, investors who fled the market out of fear of the death cross missed sizable gains that came along later. Those who bought the dip gained handsomely in the following years.So a death cross might not be as fatal as it sounds. Instead, investors should treat it as just one of the alarming signs—among many others—they should watch for.Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com"

PYPL,11/30/18,Why eBay is betting on payments to help its turnaround,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-ebay-is-betting-on-payments-to-help-its-turnaround-2018-11-30,"EBay Inc. is hoping for a revival of sorts, and it’s betting that a more active role in payments might help spice up the platform.Payments were once deemed a boring area not worth the time or investment for e-commerce companies, but marketplaces are now taking control of this part of their business as a way to enhance the shopping experience for both buyers and sellers. Shoppers often leave their carts behind if the checkout process takes too long, and small merchants have no shortage of options when it comes to selling items online. EBay EBAY, +1.17%  executives believe a more simplified payments experience will make the platform more appealing on both sides.The company is in the early days of a move toward managed payments that will eventually relegate PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, +2.53% which was spun out of eBay in 2015, to a lesser role on the site. The e-commerce platform is following in the footsteps of online peers Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +4.86%  and Etsy Inc. ETSY, +4.76% both of which mix payments with the services they offer sellers. EBay expects that overall fees for sellers will come down under the new initiative.Don’t miss: EBay is learning from Spotify in its bid to make shopping more personalEarlier this fall, eBay began migrating a small portion of its volume from PayPal to its new managed-payments service, which is being done in partnership with European payment-processor Adyen N.V. ADYEN, +2.79% Most sellers are seeing a 25% savings on fees when the company is managing everything for them end-to-end, Alyssa Cutright, eBay’s vice president of global payments, told MarketWatch.When eBay announced the move to manage payments back in January, Chief Executive Devin Wenig said he expected the move would “capture significantly better economics while reducing overall selling costs.”The goal is for sellers to also be able to handle logistics more seamlessly, with just one contract required for both payments and selling, as well as a single company to contact with any issues. “Often sellers will call with questions on payments and we’ll have to say we don’t have information on that and that they have to contact PayPal,” Cutright said. “It’s hard when you don’t have the whole picture.”See also: Square expands business-lending program through eBay partnershipThe company also hopes to attract more buyers by accepting a variety of local payment methods, especially when it comes to regions where Visa Inc. V, +2.32%  and Mastercard Inc. MA, +4.37%  aren’t as prevalent.“You go into some markets and you see much more stored-value mobile or carrier-based payment options,” Cutright said. “We want to make sure that if there are buyers that we want to reach in any of these given markets, we allow them to pay in a manner that’s familiar.”PayPal also sees potential in adding more local payment methods and embarked on a global rollout of its “smart buttons” initiative in September. That technology looks at location and past habits to render relevant payments buttons for a given customer.EBay’s managed-payments system includes Apple Pay AAPL, +3.49%  as an additional checkout option, and Cutright said that 1 in 5 iOS shoppers on eBay have chosen to complete their purchases with that mobile wallet when it was listed on the platformManagement sees a $2 billion annual revenue opportunity and the potential for $500 million in incremental operating profit once the transition to managed payments is complete, which is expected to happen by the end of 2021. EBay’s operating agreement with PayPal expires in 2020, and the company is limited in how much volume it can move to the new system until then.Don’t miss: Square launches new product for merchants who won’t give up on terminalsAnalysts, too, now see payments as a catalyst that could help eBay’s stalled stock. Lowering costs for sellers is “a clear win,” D.A. Davidson’s Tom Forte told MarketWatch, while letting consumers pay with their preferred payment method instead of incentivizing them to use PayPal should benefit the platform, he reasoned.The initial transition to managed payments hasn’t come without hitches, however. Some sellers who opted in to the initial rollout have complained on eBay’s community forums that they saw their sales take a hit once they became part of the new system.“The elephant in the room is: loyal ebay customers really LOVE PayPal and TRUST PayPal,” wrote one, who cited “an immediate and drastic drop in sales” after switching over.Cutright admits that there has been a bit of consumer apprehension about the new payment system. The company has found that some buyers worry that eBay is sharing card details with sellers when PayPal isn’t listed as a checkout option, and the site has tweaked its messaging to clarify that card information remains secure.Though PayPal won’t run payments for the new eBay system, the e-commerce giant hopes to add the PayPal button as an option at checkout in 2019. Adding PayPal is “our absolute no. 1 priority that we are working on with urgency,” Cutright said.Read: PayPal sees encouraging growth from Venmo; stock surgesThe bumpy rollout is “a little concerning,” Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian told MarketWatch, though he said that the transition is a long-term process. By virtue of the operating agreement with PayPal, eBay has to migrate volume to the new system gradually, which should give it time to work out the kinks, he argued.Advertising is another key element of the eBay turnaround story, according to Arounian. The company is making a bigger push into promoted listings.EBay shares have fallen 21% so far this year, while the S&P 500                           SPX, +1.09%                    has gained 2.5%.Emily Bary is a MarketWatch reporter based in New York.Join the conversation"

Some of the reports’ issuers have provided, or hope to provide, investment-banking or other services to the companies being analyzed.Buy • Price $127.54 on Nov. 27 by R.W. BairdThe cloud-computing company reported a beat-and-raise third-quarter 2019 (ended in October) and provided an estimated initial fiscal 2020 (January) revenue guidance gain of 20% to 21%, year over year. (The consensus estimated gain was at 20%.)This positive forward guidance, along with CEO Mark Benioff’s comments around strong macro conditions in the Americas and Asia Pacific, should remove portions of a bear case weighing on an uncertain 2019.We have conviction at current levels and reiterate Salesforce as a top large-cap pick with a Buy rating. That said, we are lowering our price target to $165 to reflect recent pullbacks in software-as-a-service comparison-group valuations.Buy Price $80.05 on Nov. 27 by Canaccord GenuityIt’s time to step up. We are upgrading the shares of the process-optimization company to a Buy. Our struggle with Aspen has largely been tied to valuation—we could never get comfortable paying 30 times to 35 times forward free cash flow for mid-single digit growth. (The company provides its services to chemical, medical, oil-and-gas, and food-processing businesses, among others.)For better or worse, two things have changed our view of Aspen: First, the stock is down 33% from September highs, so that valuation is now a more reasonably estimated 24 times enterprise value/free cash flow on calendar 2019. And second, our confidence has increased in a reacceleration that should see it growing 10%-plus in the next couple of years.Stepping back, our experience has been that, in periods of market volatility, investors crowd into perceived havens, often defined by high visibility and margins.With 40%-plus free-cash-flow profits, five- to six-year term contracts, and a technical edge that demands customer loyalty—in the processing of fluid substances, rather than the assembling of, say, electronic parts—Aspen fits the “haven” bill.We see the stock at $100 again at some point in 2019.Buy Price $36.33 on Nov. 27 by CowenOverall, the gross margin; sales, general, and administrative expense, or SG&A; and capital expenditure commentary on the sports and outdoor gear retailer’s call suggest that its margin profile is stabilizing. Consider these numbers:1) Dick’s surpassed third-quarter 2018 expectations on improved expense control, which led to earnings per share of 39 cents, above our estimate of 37 cents and the consensus estimate of 26 cents.2) SG&A dollars were at -2.5%, year over year, on a per-store basis and -1.5% overall, driven by expense management.3) Third-quarter same-store sales, or SSS, had some bright spots as apparel momentum drove SSS up to mid-single digit gains for outdoor/athletic. Footwear, though, was flattish, due to a self-inflicted underinventoried position.4) Dick’s merchandise margin was up.5) Overall inventory was up 0.8%, but down -1.2% on a “shifted” or “for special occasions” basis. Levels are expected to rise by year end, as Dick’s reinvests in these “enthusiast” categories.Our rating and price target of $39 are unchanged.Equal Weight Price $22.22 on Nov. 26 by Morgan Stanley ResearchThe branded footwear and apparel developer, marketer, and retailer appeals especially to young and athletic men and women. It sells its merchandise under its own logos and others’.Under Armour will host its first investor day in three years on Dec. 12. We see a 40% chance that it outlines a credible five-year path. This could drive the stock 10% or higher, in our view, which options currently do not price in.The bull/bear debate on Under Armour among investors remains fierce, with bulls eyeing a 10%-plus five-year Ebit margin target. Consensus forecasts a 6% 2020 (two-year) Ebit margin, and we think the market expects a high-single digit five-year Ebit-margin target.We see three potential stock outcomes:Base Case: Stock moves up about 5%, and grinds higher as consensus estimates move slightly higher and the market gains more confidence. Likelihood: 5%.Bull Case: The stock moves up about 10%. Consensus estimates move significantly higher, forcing many shorts to cover. A compelling path to a double-digit Ebit margin—new products drive new long-only money into the name. Likelihood: 10%.Bear Case: Stock moves down 10%. Under Armour’s low-mid-single digit revenue compound annual growth rate guidance calls into question Under Armor’s ability to reignite the brand. Likelihood: 10%.Our target price—$22.22 at the time of this writing—is more than a dollar above the shares’ current price of $21.Email: editors@barrons.com"

Shares of software company Adobe Inc. ADBE, +1.74%  were Wednesday’s second-best performer on the S&P 500, with a 7.3% gain.Salesforce shares, which last week had experienced their worst day in nearly three years, popped above their 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 14. The stock price is still 12.8% off its all-time high of $161.19 set on Oct. 1, days after the company wrapped up its annual Dreamforce convention in San Francisco.Of the 43 analysts who cover Salesforce, 39 have buy or overweight ratings, four have hold ratings and no one has a sell or underweight rating. Of those, eight analysts raised their price targets and three lowered theirs, resulting in an average price target of $171.82, down from the average of $172.08 before earnings, according to FactSet data.Monness Crespi analyst Brian White said Salesforce’s conference call was “the most bullish we’ve heard this earnings season from a tech company,” while Canaccord analyst Richard Davis said Salesforce is key in digital transformation, or where companies adopt software-based solutions for business processes.“In order, Salesforce, ServiceNow NOW, +1.52% , Microsoft MSFT, +1.08% Workday WDAY, +2.32%  and Adobe ADBE, +1.74%  are leading that charge among public companies,” Davis said. “This is bad news for legacy vendors such as IBM IBM, +0.84% , SAP SAP, +1.55%  and Oracle ORCL, +2.19% and it’s why the first two have thrown an M&A equivalent of a ‘Hail Mary’ with big acquisitions they hope will be transformative.”Recently, IBM offered to buy Red Hat Inc. for $34 billion, while SAP said it would buy Utah-based software company Qualtrics for $8 billion.Read: Forecasts see no dark clouds on horizon for Salesforce, NutanixBTIG analyst Joel Fishbein said Salesforce’s outlook for fiscal 2020 was key in instilling confidence in investors.“The initiation of the company’s FY20 revenue outlook at $16B (at the high end of the range, 20-21% y/y growth) is encouraging and signals multiyear visibility at a time when investors are increasingly worried that this tech gravy train can’t go on forever,” Fishbein said.Both Cowen analyst J. Derrick Wood and Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne noted that perceived weakness going forward isn’t reflecting on fundamentals given that currency exchange will impose a $200 million headwind in the fourth quarter as opposed to a $130 million tailwind in the year-ago quarter, and that Salesforce had a huge fourth quarter last year, making comparisons difficult.“Importantly, the co. did not indicate the deceleration was due to any slowdown in the business and mgmt reiterated its bullish stance about the health of the demand environment and its pipeline heading into the end of the year,” Wood noted.Jefferies analyst John DiFucci observed: “What stuck out to us was the comment that CEOs in Europe appear to be more conservative and less optimistic than their counterparts in the U.S. and Asia,” DiFucci noted. “While nothing to be alarmed over given the strength in EMEA in recent quarters, we think this is worth monitoring for Salesforce and the overall software group.”Raymond James analyst Brian Peterson noted: “While shares aren’t immune from broader macro trends, large deal activity in F3Q was clearly better than feared, suggesting that CRM’s tailwinds are long-term in nature.”Among the minority of “hold” analysts, Needham analyst Scott Berg said: “While we remain Hold-rated on CRM shares, the company’s 3Q results and initial FY20 revenue guidance were markedly better than expectations and have us more constructive on the shares.”Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser referred to third-quarter results as “decent” and reinforced his “positive long-term view on the company” but kept his rating at hold and his price target at $140.For the fourth quarter, Salesforce said it expects adjusted earnings of 54 cents to 55 cents a share on revenue of $3.55 billion to $3.56 billion, and revenue of $15.9 billion to $16 billion for fiscal 2020.As a result, analysts lowered their forecasts to a consensus 55 cents a share from a previous 57 cents a share, and raised their revenue forecast to $3.56 billion from a previous $3.52 billion. For fiscal 2020, analysts raised the consensus to $15.96 billion from a previous $15.8 billion.Wallace Witkowski is a MarketWatch news editor in San Francisco.

In today’s After the Bell, we……wonder whether we’ll see any progress in trade before the year-end;…explain why companies have been pulling back from spending plans despite record-high earnings;… and observe a software firm’s stock surge today.Fed Still MattersThe dovish tone from Fed Chair Jerome Powell today might have eased the nerve of some investors who worry the central bank might be tightening too much.The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 617.70 points, or 2.5%, to 25,366.43, while the S&P 500 rose 61.61 points, or 2.3%, to 2743.78 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 208.89 points, or 3.0%, to 7291.59.Powell said on Wednesday that rates are “just below” neutral–that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down economic growth, hinting that the Fed lighten up next year. “Given signs of a global slowdown and extreme market volatility over the past few months, investors will be keen for a sense of the Fed’s hiking plans for next year,” writes Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group on Wednesday.Fed policy is not the only uncertainty in the market, as trade headlines from the White House has also been contradicting ahead of the G20 meeting later this week, which is viewed as “the last opportunity this year to move trade talks forward,” according to Lawler.Kristina Hooper, a strategist at Invesco, is not optimistic about the outcome of the G20 meeting. President Donald Trump insisted on new tariff threats just ahead of the meeting, writes Hooper, and Chinese President Xi Jinping may not be under pressure to make concessions. “After all, China has the ability to play a long game and the U.S. doesn’t,” she writes on Wednesday.Hooper points out that China has many more weapons in its arsenal in a trade war, including depreciating the currency, launching fiscal stimuli, lowering taxes and interest rates increasing subsidies, and ending the purchasing of U.S. Treasuries, to name a few.Uncertainty on the trade dispute has been hindering companies from spending more. Corporations have pulled back on expenditures even as the economy is expanding at one of its fastest paces of the cycle.According to data released on Wednesday by the Commerce Department, business spending on equipment in the third quarter has registered the weakest growth since the fourth quarter of 2016, and contributed only 0.2 percentage points to the GDP’s 3.5% growth. During the same quarter last year, the contribution was 0.6 percentage points out of 2.8% GDP growth.“The trade dispute has been difficult to navigate for U.S. corporations, and many have opted to put future expansions on hold until there is more clarity on the tangible and intangible effects of tariffs on demand and profits,” writes John Lynch of LPL Financial on Wednesday.Crude oil prices are now down more than 30% from the October peak, hurting the profit margins of energy companies and their spending plans.But Lynch thinks the slowdown of business spending is only temporary and things will start picking up.“Once U.S. businesses have clarity on trade, they may be able to focus more on boosting growth and productivity, which may fuel the next leg of the U.S. economic expansion.” writes Lynch.The Hot StockSalesforce.com (CRM) shot to the top of the S&P 500 Wednesday, bolstered by upbeat third-quarter earnings.Salesforce.com gained $13.10, or 10.3%, to $140.64.The software firm earned 61 cents a share on revenue of $3.39 billion. Analysts were looking for EPS of 50 cents on revenue of $3.37 billion. For the full year, it sees EPS of $2.60 to $2.61, on revenue of $13.23 billion to $13.24 billion.Macquarie’s Sarah Hindlian reiterated an Outperform rating and $174 price target on Salesforce.com, writing that the quarter was “solid,” while the conference call “suggested a positive tone bringing macro relief.”Year to date, Salesforce.com is up 37.8%The Biggest LoserTiffany (TIF) slunk to the bottom of the index, following its third-quarter earnings.Shares of the storied jeweler lost $12.41, or 11.8%, to $92.54.Tiffany said it earned 77 cents a share, matching analysts’ estimates, on revenue of $1.01 billion, below the $1.05 billion consensus. Comparable sales rose 3%, less than the 6.2% the Street was expecting. For the full year, the company sees EPS of $4.65 to $4.80, below the $4.83 analysts are modeling for.Still, CFRA’s Camilla Yanushevsky reiterated a Buy rating and $124 price target on Tiffany, writing that while she understands “concerns with [the quarter’s] sales miss, we attribute it to lower spending by Chinese tourists, which, in our view, is a cyclical trend, as sales by the domestic Chinese were strong. Long term, we are encouraged by progress CEO Alessandro Bogliolo has made to re-brand Tiffany to resonate with millennials.”Year to date, Tiffany is down 11%.–Teresa RivasWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com"

At a time when gurus’ calls are on both bullish and bearish sides, many investors found some clarity in “Here’s how to tell if stocks will enter a bear market or rise to new highs.”Important events are ahead. Let’s update the situation with the help of a chart.Please click here for an annotated chart of Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, +1.75% I chose the chart of this ETF over the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.13% the S&P 500 ETF SPY, +1.32% and the small-cap ETF IWM, +0.96% because of dominance of tech stocks in the Nasdaq 100.

This is positive.• The chart shows a very short-term bottoming pattern. This is positive.• The chart shows RSI (relative strength index) divergence. In plain English, this means that although the price fell below a prior low, RSI did not go as low. This is a mild positive.• As the chart shows, the overall pattern of RSI is positive.• The low came on somewhat heavier volume. This is mildly positive. However, this is a low conviction point; a significantly higher volume would have increased the probability of this being a bottom.• As the chart shows, the rally is on low volume. This is negative.• Positive earnings from Salesforce CRM, +0.97% and Nutanix NTNX, +0.56% are creating positive sentiment.• Smart-money flows in semiconductor stocks such as Applied Materials AMAT, +2.84% and Micron Technology MU, +3.81%  have turned to neutral from negative. Smart-money flows have been positive in Intel INTC, +1.66% through most of the tech decline; interestingly, Intel has held up well during this period. Smart-money flows turned positive in AMD AMD, +11.31% at the depth of the selloff. You already know from my writings over the years that smart-money flows have a great track record. The cherry on top is that smart-money flows were negative in Nvidia NVDA, +4.04% when the stock was trading around $290, momo (momentum) crowd flows were positive and it was the darling of tech investors. Smart-money flows stayed consistently negative on Nvidia, and ultimately the stock fell to as low as $133. Please see “The poster child of bull-market excess just dimmed the prospects of the broader stock market” to see how money flows provide you with an edge.• For the medium term, the bear is ready to pounce on some high-flying tech stocks.

The stock of Salesforce CRM, +0.97%  climbed nearly 9% after hours and was up that amount premarket Wednesday, after the customer-relationship management software firm reported a better-than-expected fiscal third quarter and a slightly better revenue outlook for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Nutanix NTNX, +0.56%  also jumped almost 9% in extended trading after posting an encouraging outlook. That stock was also up 9% premarket Wednesday.In conference calls with analysts, both companies were asked about their view of the macro economic environment.“I continue to see strong growth because I’ve seen so much investment this year. It’s going to pay out for these companies going forward,” Salesforce Co-Chief Executive Marc Benioff said. “So I see still several years ahead of good, solid growth for the economy, and where that gets tempered — I think I’ve mentioned this before — is when I talk to European CEOs, they tend to be more conservative.”However, there have been a smattering of CEOs in the U.S. who have said they are seeing a slowdown among their customers, especially in the semiconductor and semi equipment arena, a key underpinning of technology.Duston Williams, chief financial officer of Nutanix Inc. NTNX, +0.56%NTNX, +0.56% a developer of hybrid cloud software, echoed those thoughts. “We haven’t seen any slowdown in our business anyway,” he said. “Now, we’re not a $20 billion company that would have insight into everything. But certainly within our realm anyway, we’ve seen really no signs of that.”Shares of both Salesforce and Nutanix have declined in the past few weeks, with Salesforce off 23% since peaking in late September, “a victim of the selloff in popular high-growth technology,” wrote Steve Koenig, a Wedbush Securities analyst, in a recent note.Investors have been nervous about a slowdown as a potential impact from the Trump administration’s tariffs on tech products made or assembled in China, which includes some products in data-center hardware. In recent years, the build-out of more data centers across the world — both by companies for their own use and to rent out for cloud computing — has been one of the strongest growth engines in tech. Nutanix CEO Dheeraj Pandey told analysts that customers were both expanding workloads and continuing to modernize and create cloud-like experiences in their own data centers.Salesforce executives also pointed out that its fiscal-fourth-quarter revenue outlook was staying the same because of expected currency fluctuations, an issue brought up by a number of other companies, including Cisco Systems Inc.       CSCO, +1.82%Whether or not the outlook stays bright for the cloud companies is a big question going forward, but for now investors can relax. Combined with the strong results of the cloud infrastructure businesses of both Microsoft Corp.MSFT, +1.08%           and Amazon.com Inc.              AMZN, +4.86%          this quarter, cloud-related companies could be a safe haven from any impending storms, at least for now.Want this type of analysis sent to your inbox?

But during a market correction, there will be more of those, and you may find opportunities to scoop up bargains for extra profits when the broader market rebounds.In mid-October, data provided by FactSet showed that exactly half of the stocks included in the S&P 500 Index were down at least 20% from their all-time highs. With the market pulling back since then, it might be interesting to use more recent data to see which ones have declined the most from their 52-week highs.A bear market for an index or an individual stock is usually defined as a 20%-plus decline. At about 11:10 a.m. ET on Nov. 26, 206 stocks among the S&P 500 were down at least 20% from their 52-week highs. That’s a huge list, but it might be of interest to see which of the companies in bear territory are favored the most among Wall Street analysts, whose research is used by their broker colleagues to help push stock purchases.The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.13%  fell 10% from its intraday high on Oct. 3 through its intraday low on Nov. 23. The S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.09%  was down 10.5% from its intraday high on Sept. 21 through its intraday low on Nov. 23. Both benchmark indices had suffered corrections earlier in 2018. The Dow ended on Nov. 23 down 1.8% for the year, while the S&P 500 was down 1.5%.The Dow was last in a bear market heading to the post-crisis low on March 9, 2009. But even though the financial media generally agree that the bull market has continued from that date, the S&P 500 on an intraday basis was in a bear market when it fell 20.2% from an intraday high on July 1, 2011, through its intraday low on Oct. 4, 2011, according to data supplied by FactSet.Starting with the 206 S&P 500 stocks in bear territory (from 52-week highs) through 11:10 a.m. ET on Nov. 26, we have narrowed the list to 22 companies that are covered by at least 10 analysts, with at least 80% of the analysts rating the shares a “buy” or equivalent, according to FactSet.Here they are, ranked by the percentage of buy ratings:Don’t miss: Here’s how to easily reduce your investment risk just at the right timeCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn’s Deep Dive columns here.Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

Materne has a outperform rating and a target price of $170.On the conference call Tuesday, Salesforce Co-Chief Executive and Chairman Marc Benioff backed up the company’s outlook, saying he doesn’t expect the economy to take a downturn or slip into recession, as some fear.“I consider to see strong growth because I’ve seen so much investment this year that’s going to pay out for these companies going forward,” Benioff said. “So, I see still several years ahead of good, solid growth for the economy.”Read: Software stocks experience worst selloff in nearly 3 years as tech continues to get beaten upThe San Francisco-based company reported third-quarter net income of $105 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with $107 million, or 14 cents a share, in the year-ago period.

Analysts largely report healthy channel checks following Salesforce’s bullish annual Dreamforce conference in September, where the company revealed a Siri-enabled Einstein product following its announcement of a new enterprise partnership with Apple Inc.AAPL, +3.49% . Salesforce’s Einstein uses artificial intelligence to provide predictions and recommendations based on a company’s business processes and customer data, and faces competition from rival Microsoft Corp.MSFT, +1.08%Most analysts agreed that Salesforce shouldn’t have trouble with meeting or beating third-quarter expectations, but the fourth quarter is going to be much tougher. Salesforce’s billings outlook will be under pressure given last year’s big fourth quarter.Cowen analyst J. Derrick Wood, who has an outperform rating and a $180 price target, said investors have been concerned “for several months now” about the tough comparison that Salesforce faces in the fourth quarter.Salesforce is expected to post fourth-quarter billings of $6.81 billion, an increase of 22.6% from a year ago, according to FactSet.Monness Crespi analyst Brian White expects that no matter what Salesforce forecasts, the recent downward momentum on tech stocks may win out over fundamentals.“Although Salesforce gave off bullish vibes at Dreamforce in late September and we believe the company is positioned better than ever in the SaaS world, the market has grown more treacherous since then and the bar raised on what constitutes a strong quarter,” White, who has a buy rating and a $170 target price, said.“Given the unforgiving tech tape that we find ourselves in at the moment, the market is now wearing ‘bear goggles’ and searching for any excuse to go negative on a company.”Earnings: Of the 37 analysts surveyed by FactSet, Salesforce on average is expected to post adjusted earnings of 50 cents a share, down from the 53 cents a share expected at the beginning of the quarter. Salesforce forecast 49 cents to 50 cents a share. Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages, buy-side analysts and others, calls for earnings of 55 cents a share.Revenue: Wall Street expects revenue of $3.37 billion from Salesforce, according to 34 analysts polled by FactSet. Salesforce predicted revenue of $3.36 billion to $3.37 billion. Estimize expects revenue of $3.39 billion.Stock movement: Following Salesforce’s earnings report in late August, shares have fallen 18.3% as of Monday’s close, compared with an 8.3% decline in the S&P 500 index  SPX, +1.09%    and a 12.7% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index  COMP, +1.51%  over the same period. Recently, software stocks and Salesforce shares had their worst day in nearly three years in Nov. 19’s tech selloff.What analysts are saying: Of the 42 analysts who cover Salesforce, 38 have buy or overweight ratings, four have hold ratings and no one has a sell or underweight rating, with an average price target of $172.08.Jefferies analyst John DiFucci, who has a buy rating and a $189 price target, said Salesforce hitting the consensus for its fourth-quarter billing outlook is “certainly achievable.”“However, we note that CRM could guide below expectations, which it sometimes does (and tends to subsequently beat) due to what we view as a conservative approach to guidance,” DiFucci noted. “Regardless, we believe that the pipeline is robust, though the 4Q compare is relatively difficult after several years of strong finishes to the year.”Instinet analyst Christopher Eberle, who has a buy rating and a $181 target price, reminded investors that Salesforce will only be providing guidance for billings going forward, or expected revenue over the next 12 months, which he views as “an improved metric, as it reflects unbilled expected revenue, compared with unearned revenue, which only reflected billed business.”Wallace Witkowski is a MarketWatch news editor in San Francisco.

MSFT,11/30/18,How Microsoft Beat Out Apple and Became the World’s Most Valuable Company,https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-microsoft-beat-out-apple-and-became-the-worlds-most-valuable-company-1543623288,"Digital Equipment. Sun Microsystems. Nokia. Technology history is littered with shooting-star companies that burn brightly for a time, then disappear into the night.That’s what makes Microsoft’s (ticker: MSFT) recent revival so special. Under Satya Nadella’s leadership, the old tech giant pivoted, put its cash cows at risk, and successfully transitioned to the next big technology wave—cloud computing.This week, the stock market validated Microsoft’s turnaround when its shares surpassed Apple (AAPL) as the world’s most valuable public company. The company last held the No. 1 spot in 2003.So how did this legacy technology vendor become relevant again, and what can the industry learn from its resurgence?The turnaround is directly linked to Nadella’s appointment in 2014, a transition that Barron’s chronicled in a cover story a year into his tenure. While Microsoft was still extremely profitable, investors had all but given up on the company, which seemed to have missed the rise of mobile. At the time, Microsoft’s stock had fallen nearly 40% since the end of 1999, versus the S&P 500’s 20% gain. Microsoft experienced mixed receptions to its Windows 8, Windows Phone, and Bing search-engine offerings. As Nadella took the top spot, Microsoft’s core Windows division had seen profits fall 18% in the prior fiscal year.So Nadella took action. In July 2014, he wrote in a memo to employees: “Microsoft is the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world,” departing from the company’s prior worldview centered around Windows.“Nadella changed the overall direction of the company and saw the business opportunity in the cloud,” Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler, an early bull on Microsoft stock, told Barron’s in a phone interview on Thursday.The bet on cloud computing was prescient. Last week, Baird estimated that every dollar spent on cloud-computing services has replaced $3 to $4 of legacy technology expenditures. That means Microsoft’s cloud is getting dollars that used to go to enterprise giants Cisco Systems (CSCO) and IBM (IBM). Corporate America continues to embrace the cloud’s efficiencies, a trend that could continue for years, Baird says.A June JPMorgan survey of more than 150 chief information officers revealed that only 23% of corporate technology workloads are currently on the cloud. The same executives predicted that the figure will rise to 52% by 2023.Nadella positioned Microsoft to become a major player in the burgeoning market. The company is now a clear No. 2, with 13% share of cloud-computing share behind Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services at 52%, according to Gartner’s 2017 figures. The gap is shrinking, as Microsoft’s Azure cloud sales rose at a 76% clip in its most recent quarter, compared with AWS’ 46%.Perhaps no one can appreciate Nadella’s turnaround more than his predecessor. “Satya has done a phenomenal job driving Microsoft’s cloud efforts—particularly Office 365 and Azure,” Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft CEO and current owner of the National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Clippers, wrote in an email to Barron’s. “There is a lot of upside that has really started to show in the company’s financial results the last year. He has also brought some growth back to one of Microsoft’s biggest profit makers, Windows. That is so critical to Microsoft’s overall success.”Nadella has also reinvigorated Microsoft’s productivity software, by emphasizing the subscription version of Office known as Office 365. The recurring revenue is an investors’ dream. Microsoft and other software makers are benefiting. “Nadella changed the culture of the company away from a product focus to one that delivers the best solution for what the customer needs,” Moerdler said.Meanwhile, Microsoft Office for iPad was launched in March 2014, right after Nadella became CEO, a signal that the company intended to serve its customers on any platform. The tablet offering requires an Office 365 subscription for full editing capabilities.In its fiscal-year 2014, subscriptions accounted for just 10% of its commercial Microsoft Office revenue. Three years later, the company revealed that subscription-based Office 365 sales surpassed the revenue from its traditional license sales.The strategy to accelerate customer-focused subscriptions and the cloud business is paying off. In its most recent quarter, Microsoft said sales and earnings rose 19% and 36%, respectively. Since Nadella took over as CEO, the company’s stock has risen more than 200% and outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 150 percentage points.On Friday, Microsoft had a market value of $851 billion, enough to beat Apple’s $847 billion. Apple shares declined 18% in November on worries about the latest iPhone product cycle, while Microsoft stock rose 4%.Investors are paying up for the new Microsoft, valuing the company at 23 times Wall Street’s estimated 2019 earnings. Hardware-centric Apple trades at just 13 times.Moerdler said that Microsoft may deserve the higher multiple because of its business model. While Apple is trying to shift its narrative to services, the iPhone segment still accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s sales.“Microsoft has far more recurring and consistent revenue streams versus Apple and is not tied to a hardware product cycle,” Moerdler said. “Microsoft’s growth opportunities are much more visible to investors.”Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.com"
MSFT,11/30/18,Microsoft surpasses Apple as most valuable U.S. company,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-surpasses-apple-as-most-valuable-us-company-2018-11-30,"It’s official: Microsoft Corp. on Friday took back its title as the most valuable U.S. company by market capitalization at the close of trading, unseating Apple Inc. after a more than two-year run in the top spot.Microsoft MSFT, +1.08%  shares rose 0.6% to close at $110.89 Friday for a market cap of $851.22 billion, while Apple’s AAPL, +3.49%  stock fell 0.5% to close at $178.58 for a market cap of $847.43 billion. Earlier in the week, Microsoft briefly snatched the crown away from Apple in intraday trading, but Apple had regained its top spot by the market close.Since Aug. 1, 2013, Apple has held the title of most valuable U.S. company for all but two days when Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG, +1.10%GOOGL, +0.60%  market cap closed above Apple’s on Feb. 2, 2016, and May 12, 2016, according to Dow Jones data.Apple first surpassed Microsoft in market cap back on May 28, 2010, when both companies were worth about $226 billion, according to FactSet.But back then, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization was Exxon Mobil Corp.    XOM, +2.16%   which Apple last unseated as most valuable in January 2012, after first taking it away in 2011.The last time Microsoft held the title as the most valuable U.S. company was Nov. 3, 2003, or 3,796 trading days, according to Dow Jones data.Apple hit a market capitalization of $1.103 trillion back on Oct. 3, 2018, from which shares have fallen 23.5% in the meantime. But it’s that decline that handed Microsoft the crown as Microsoft shares have only slipped 3.7% since then.For the year, Microsoft shares are up 29.6% while Apple shares are up 5.5%. In comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average                           DJIA, +1.13%                    is up 3.3%, the S&P 500 index                           SPX, +1.09%                    is up 3.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index                           COMP, +1.51%                    is up 6.2%.Wallace Witkowski is a MarketWatch news editor in San Francisco.

MSFT,11/30/18,"Sell U.S. Tech Stocks, Buy Emerging Markets, Says Rob Arnott",https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-u-s-tech-stocks-buy-emerging-markets-says-rob-arnott-1543516901,"Investors may be thrilled that U.S. stocks have rallied, pushing the S&P 500 to a 4.4% total return for the year, including dividends, as of the close on Wednesday. But the good times probably won’t last, according to Rob Arnott, founder of the investment research firm Research Affiliates and co-manager of funds such as Pimco All Asset All Authority (ticker: PAUAX).A value-oriented contrarian, Arnott has long warned that U.S. stocks look pricey. And he’s especially concerned now that a handful of big tech stocks are carrying the market on their shoulders.“U.S. stocks have gotten frothy and expensive,” Arnott told Barron’s in an interview. “The FAANG stocks, in particular, are priced for perfection. If they don’t reinforce the notion that they’ll be 10 times as large a decade from now, then they’re overpriced and will perform badly.”The FAANGs refer to Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Along with a few other big-tech stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Chinese internet firms Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU), they have become a huge source of market concentration and power: Their total equity value tops $4.2 trillion, and they have been fueling the market’s gains.“The seven or eight largest companies on the planet are all tech darlings,” says Arnott. “Is that a diversified roster of top tier companies? Hardly.”Arnott points out that U.S. stocks trade at 30 times earnings, based on the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE) from the last 10 years, a valuation measure developed by Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller. The CAPE ratio only topped 30 once in history, just before the dot-com collapse, he says.Emerging markets, by contrast, look like a screaming buy. They trade at a CAPE ratio of 13. Investors worry that declining currencies and commodity prices will keep emerging markets depressed, and that the trade war between the U.S. and China will continue to be a drag on growth.But Arnott views those fears as overblown. “Will the trade war materially change the trajectory of half the world’s gross domestic product over the next 10 years?” he asks. “The answer is no.You cannot have a bargain in the absence of bad news that could get worse before it gets better. If you can accept that, then you have an opportunity to get some very good deals.”Granted, investors in Pimco All Asset All Authority haven’t seen great returns. The fund is down about 7% this year, and its 10-year annualized return of 5% trails 90% of mutual funds in the moderate-target-risk category, according to Morningstar.Arnott points out that most funds in the category are typically anchored to a 60/40 mix of stocks and bonds. All Authority aims to be different, holding what he calls “third-pillar” assets that can protect investors in a bear market and should do well in an inflationary environment: commodities, Treasury-inflation protected securities, and real-estate investment trusts. He also likes “stealth inflation fighters” such as emerging-market stocks and bonds, and high-yield U.S. junk bonds.Moreover, the fund is typically short the U.S. stock market, betting it will go down. “We actually have to love U.S. stocks in order to go above 0% in net U.S. stock exposure in All Authority,” he wrote in an email to Barron’s. Not surprisingly, he added, our returns “are in line with our home-base third pillar markets.”Those markets had an average return of 0.8% over the last five years. “That’s why our return lagged US stock-centric approaches—not because we’ve had an increasingly cautious view on U.S. equities,” he said.Still, it has been a painful slog for investors who have stuck with the fund while U.S. stocks have climbed, rising at a 14% annualized gain over the last decade, based on returns for the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY).“All Authority’s home base–away from mainstream stocks and bonds–will reliably lead to underperformance in a bull market,” Arnott tells Barron’s. “That’s what diversification does in a bull market.” At the end of what is now the longest bull market in history, he adds, “this is not a time to worry about the drag imposed by diversifying asset classes. “Indeed, Arnott sees a good chance that markets will start moving in his favor: He pegs the odds of a bear market breaking out in the U.S. in the near term at 40%. Investors might do well in a fund without much correlation to U.S. stocks in that scenario, though as he acknowledges, they may have to wait for their patience to be rewarded.“Do I have high confidence that the asset classes we focus on will beat U.S. stocks next year? No,” he says. “But I have high confidence they’ll win over a 10-year horizon.”Write to Daren Fonda at daren.fonda@barrons.com"

Ives reaffirmed his $140 price target for the company’s shares.Companies are shifting huge sums of their technology spending to the cloud as it offers better reliability, an easier path to scaling up, and greater cost efficiencies versus using traditional on-premises computing equipment.According to Gartner, Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services was the leader in cloud computing with a 52% market share last year, followed by Microsoft at 13%, Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) at 5%, and Alphabet ’s (GOOGL) Google at 3%.The analyst noted that Microsoft’s Azure cloud business grew 76% in its most recent quarter. He estimated 30% of technology workloads are currently on the cloud, a share that he said will rise to 55% by 2022. Ives believes Microsoft’s cloud growth is in its early stages.“We believe the shift to cloud is a major secular trend that is significantly benefiting MSFT in the field as a key tailwind and should continue its momentum heading into FY2019,” he wrote.Microsoft has significantly outperformed the market this year.

MSFT,11/29/18,Microsoft Could Beat Apple as the Most Valuable Company. But the ‘Winner’s Curse’ Looms.,https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-versus-apple-market-value-1543426598,"Apple stock (AAPL) has tumbled in recent weeks while Microsoft stock (MSFT) has held fairly steady—and the two giants are suddenly neck and neck for the title of largest company by market value.That should give Microsoft shareholders pause.There’s a well-known tendency of companies that reach the top spot by market value to underperform for years afterward. But even more important than trend is the likely cause behind it. Rob Arnott has studied “The Winners Curse” for the broad U.S. market, individual sectors, and overseas markets. He found in each case that top dogs earn lousy 10-year returns. In the U.S. market, for example, there were six leaders between 1952 and 2010, and they underperformed by a whopping five percentage points per year in the decade after taking the top spot.Arnott has skin in the game as founder and chairman of Research Affiliates, which markets investment indexes that weight companies by economic factors, not market value. The thinking is that a high stock value is a negative predictor of future returns, while high earnings, revenues, dividends, and so on are not. The firm says its approach to indexing is thus superior to tracking indexes like the S&P 500.Listen to a conversation between Jack Hough and Alex Eule about what to do with Facebook’s unloved stock in a recent episode of The Readback. You can sign up for the podcast in iTunes or wherever you listen to podcasts.Apple kept the top spot Wednesday, with Apple stock closing up 3.9% for a market capitalization of about $858 billion. Microsoft stock closed up 3.7%, to end the day at a market value if about $852 billion.In his 2012 study, Arnott considered a handful of possible explanations for The Winner’s Curse. The top companies in their fields can attract unwanted regulation, antitrust action, and public scorn. “Being #1 means always having to say you’re sorry!” Arnott wrote in the Journal of Indexes. Stock market leaders also get lots of media coverage, and prior research has shown that to be an undesirable thing for returns. But the most plausible explanation, as Arnott put it, is that “a high price is often needed to get to the vaunted #1 rank by market cap.”Read our recent cover story: The tornado in tech stocksThe existence of a common-sense explanation for The Winner’s Curse is important because the sample size of leaders to study isn’t huge, and there are exceptions to the rule. Exxon Mobil  (XOM) has been a poor performer over the past decade, but it has been hanging around the U.S. market’s top 10 list for more than a half-century, so its size hasn’t historically been a hindrance. In data going back to 1981, it has traded at an average of 14 times trailing earnings—reasonable enough to suggest a lofty valuation hasn’t been much of a hindrance, either. Compare that with Microsoft, which went for more than 60 times earnings in September 1998, when it topped General Electric  (GE) to become the largest U.S. company. Over the following decade, it returned about half as much as the market.Microsoft isn’t nearly that expensive today. But it isn’t cheap either. Barron’s wrote favorably about the company more than three years ago. Microsoft stock has returned 155% since, including dividends, trouncing the market by more than 100 points. But consider that while Microsoft and Apple are close in market value, they are far apart in economic output. Apple is expected to clear more than $63 billion in free cash in its current fiscal year through Sep. 2019, compared to about $36 billion for Microsoft in its fiscal year ending June 2019.Based on free cash projections, Microsoft has risen from a 29% discount to the S&P 500 at the time of our 2015 story, to a recent 16% premium. Apple, meanwhile, traded recently at a 38% discount. Microsoft is seen as the faster grower of the two, with Wall Street looking for three-year, compounded earnings per share growth averaging 15%, versus 11% for Apple. But if The Winner’s Curse is owed more to valuation than just size, Microsoft shareholders should be more concerned from here about having regained the top spot than Apple investors should be about losing it.Write to Jack Hough at jack.hough@barrons.com"

However, this is a low conviction point; a significantly higher volume would have increased the probability of this being a bottom.• As the chart shows, the rally is on low volume.

Smart-money flows have been positive in Intel INTC, +1.66% through most of the tech decline; interestingly, Intel has held up well during this period. Smart-money flows turned positive in AMD AMD, +11.31% at the depth of the selloff. You already know from my writings over the years that smart-money flows have a great track record. The cherry on top is that smart-money flows were negative in Nvidia NVDA, +4.04% when the stock was trading around $290, momo (momentum) crowd flows were positive and it was the darling of tech investors. Smart-money flows stayed consistently negative on Nvidia, and ultimately the stock fell to as low as $133.

Many money managers have incentives tied to “locking in gains” before the end of the year, and of course President Trump wants all the bragging rights he can get.The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.13%  rose 288 points (1.1%) on Monday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +1.09%  also added 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.51%  was up 1.5% after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to get serious about trade negotiations. Following a dinner Saturday night in Buenos Aires during the G-20 gathering, the U.S. agreed not to impose 25% tariffs on $200 billion in annual imports from China in January. This opens a 90-day window for a trade agreement.Read: Asia-Pacific stocks jump on U.S.-China trade truceTrump also said China had agreed to “reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S.”Stocks were also helped by a 4.2% increase in West Texas Intermediate crude CLF9, +0.93% following an agreement between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman to cut production.Among the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, all but eight were up on Monday:You can click the tickers for more on each company, including news, profiles, price ratios, ratings and financials.Here are the 10 best-performing S&P 500 stocks on Monday:And here are the 10 best performers among the Nasdaq 100    NDX, +1.63%   :Don’t miss: Utility stocks have beaten the S&P 500 in two months of turbulence and in the long runCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn’s Deep Dive columns here.Want news about Asia delivered to your inbox?

At a time when gurus’ calls are on both bullish and bearish sides, many investors found some clarity in “Here’s how to tell if stocks will enter a bear market or rise to new highs.”Important events are ahead. Let’s update the situation with the help of a chart.Please click here for an annotated chart of Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, +1.75% I chose the chart of this ETF over the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.13% the S&P 500 ETF SPY, +1.32% and the small-cap ETF IWM, +0.96% because of dominance of tech stocks in the Nasdaq 100. The four largest components in the Nasdaq 100 are Apple AAPL, +3.49% Amazon AMZN, +4.86% Microsoft MSFT, +1.08% and Google GOOG, +1.10%GOOGL, +0.60% Please note the following:• The chart shows a move above the trend line. This is positive.• The chart shows a very short-term bottoming pattern. This is positive.• The chart shows RSI (relative strength index) divergence. In plain English, this means that although the price fell below a prior low, RSI did not go as low. This is a mild positive.• As the chart shows, the overall pattern of RSI is positive.• The low came on somewhat heavier volume. This is mildly positive. However, this is a low conviction point; a significantly higher volume would have increased the probability of this being a bottom.• As the chart shows, the rally is on low volume. This is negative.• Positive earnings from Salesforce CRM, +0.97% and Nutanix NTNX, +0.56% are creating positive sentiment.• Smart-money flows in semiconductor stocks such as Applied Materials AMAT, +2.84% and Micron Technology MU, +3.81%  have turned to neutral from negative. Smart-money flows have been positive in Intel INTC, +1.66% through most of the tech decline; interestingly, Intel has held up well during this period. Smart-money flows turned positive in AMD AMD, +11.31% at the depth of the selloff. You already know from my writings over the years that smart-money flows have a great track record. The cherry on top is that smart-money flows were negative in Nvidia NVDA, +4.04% when the stock was trading around $290, momo (momentum) crowd flows were positive and it was the darling of tech investors. Smart-money flows stayed consistently negative on Nvidia, and ultimately the stock fell to as low as $133. Please see “The poster child of bull-market excess just dimmed the prospects of the broader stock market” to see how money flows provide you with an edge.• For the medium term, the bear is ready to pounce on some high-flying tech stocks.

WB,11/28/18,Weibo Reports Third Quarter 2018 Unaudited Financial Results,http://www.wsj.com/articles/PR-CO-20181128-905934,
WUBA,11/28/18,A Trade War Truce Might Be Around the Corner,https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-china-g20-meeting-1542753555,"Investors may spend their weekend trying to dissect the body language between President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping when the two meet Saturday on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting in Buenos Aires.Chinese stocks—and those in emerging markets—have shown signs of a recovery after a brutal year, helped by hopes of a Trump and Xi forging a détente at the G-20 meeting. But that optimism has been dinged by the acrimony out of the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, as Vice President Mike Pence sharpened his attacks on China and world leaders failed to agree on a communique—a first in the summit’s 29-year history. Remarks this week by Larry Kudlow, the Director of the National Economic Council, voicing skepticism that the meeting could end in a de-escalation also fueled pessimism. Kudlow said the two countries are having talks at all levels.China and the U.S. may be in a new economic cold war, as the two powerhouses spar over issues ranging from market access, complaints that China is forcing U.S. companies to transfer their technology, and advantages in areas like artificial intelligence. But even cold wars have cooling periods, and people who closely watch U.S. and China relations see signs the two could move to de-escalate the situation. Such a détente, even if brief, could give the nascent recovery in emerging market stocks a boost, and also ease pressure on technology and other global companies in the crosshairs of trade tensions. The New York Times reported this week that a truce could be in the works.The biggest incentive for making nice is to avert a potential global economic slump. If no progress is made by the end of the year, the U.S. is on track to raise tariffs from the current 10% to 25% on $250 billion in Chinese goods. China will almost surely respond. Tariffs were among the risks U.S. companies like Caterpillar (CAT) highlighted in their earnings outlooks. The trade war could dent profitability across a wider swath of companies if tariffs rise. China has its own incentives. As officials try to tackle the leverage in its economy and slow its economic growth, China is left with less cushion and fewer tools to offset the hit from rising tariffs.And implementing the next wave of tariff increases will be complicated, if the wrangling between sub-sectors over the first batch of tariffs was any indication.“No one wants to deal with the intricacies of tariffs jumping to 25%,” says Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the American Enterprise Institute who consults with Trump administration officials. “Both sides want to avoid tariff escalation, and that gives powerful incentive for a short-term deal, such as China resuming to buy soybeans or natural gas and the U.S. not escalating tariffs on Jan. 1 and giving the two sides an opportunity to negotiate further. That’s an easy thing to tout out of the meeting.”De-escalation could come in different forms. The U.S. could agree to postpone the increase in tariffs until March or lower tariffs to 10% on all Chinese goods—something China could live with and Trump could still spin as a victory. In return, the Chinese could indicate it will do a better job in accelerating market access or protecting intellectual property rights.A détente could also create favorable optics for Trump, especially against a backdrop of General Motors (GM) announcing layoffs,the stock market’s recent slump, and Republicans losing the House in the midterm elections. Trump “needs a big win” like the kind he might get from a China deal, Gavekal Research’s Anatole Kaletsky writes in a note. In many of Trump’s confrontations with other countries, Kaletsky notes, his modus operandi “has been to dramatically escalate U.S. rhetoric, just before negotiating a tactical retreat.”And then there are the optics created by language. At a recent news conference, Trump wrongly suggested that China had canceled its Made in China 2025 policy, a cornerstone of its economic reform and development plans. That is far from the case, and not a policy China is going to back away from, Scissors says. But he adds that China may be willing to make superficial changes to appease Trump and dial down the trade tensions.What is not likely to emerge from a meeting between the two leaders is a detailed or comprehensive agreement that takes trade off investors’ list of worries. “This is part of a long-term process,” says Andy Rothman, a former diplomat who spends a lot of time traveling between Beijing and Washington as an investment strategist at Matthews Asia. “Changes have been gradual. What I’m expecting is a positive conversation in Buenos Aires that will change the tone and direction of bilateral negotiations and put them on a better footing. If there are positive signals, that is going to boost sentiment among investors in China and the U.S.”Emerging markets stocks will be a beneficiary since China makes up nearly a third of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and has a lot of sway on regional economic growth, says Jorge Mariscal, chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management. The MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) has gained almost 5% so far this month, recouping some of the ground it has lost through this year. Mariscal has a buy recommendation on Chinese stocks, noting that they are still trading near global financial crisis levels, with sectors like industrial manufacturers, auto companies, and technology stocks benefiting from a de-escalation in trade tensions.If the trade cloud looming over Chinese stocks lifts, the benefits from the stimulus measures China has implemented recently to offset its economic slowdown should becom e more apparent in the first quarter. Michael Oh, manager of the Matthews Asia Innovators fund (MATFX), has been adding companies focused on some of the smaller cities in China, where growth is still strong and the government’s stimulus should help consumers, like classified advertising business 58.com (WUBA).Given the factions within the Trump administration advocating very different approaches to China and the confluence of geopolitical tensions coloring the backdrop, it’s possible a meeting goes badly. In such an instance, Mariscal thinks Chinese stocks could initially slide, returning their recent gains. Over the last month, the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) index is up 8.5%. Global markets would stay on edge awaiting what happens in January. If tariffs are hiked, the reaction will be broad-based, at least until investors recalibrate their assumptions. In China, the economy would take a hit, potentially causing layoffs at exporters and pushing the government to implement a wider round of stimulus, Rothman says.Goldman Sachs  strategists write in a recent research note that the hit to earnings if the full 25% tariffs are levied on all Chinese imports could eliminate any profit growth globally next year, though companies will likely respond by shifting their supply chains and raising prices to cushion the blow.Such uncertainty—along with the widespread view that any easing of trade tensions will be a short respite in a new normal of a more contentious relationship between the two superpowers—means that countries and customers are likely to hedge their bets, investing new money to diversify their supply chains and not rely just on U.S. companies. And that could mean a lift to soybean and meat producers in Latin America, as well as countries like Vietnam and Thailand as companies try to diversify their production outside of China.This article was originally published on Nov. 21.

From tariffs and trade wars to rising interest rates and a slowing economy, jittery investors have had a spate of negative news to worry about. Tech stocks bore the brunt of the damage with high growth, momentum names falling into bear markets across the board.But if yesterday’s rousing rebound is any indication, these FANG stocks aren’t going down without a fight. The culprit for Wednesday’s snap-back was two-fold.First, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell struck a dovish tone during yesterday’s speech suggesting the current level of interest rates is nearing neutral. The commentary caused the Street to downshift the number of rate hikes expected next year. And, well, everybody jumped back into the equity pool sending stocks flying.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecond, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) delivered blowout earnings, which quelled fears that economic weakness is hampering corporate profits in tech stocks.If yesterday’s positive undertones persist, now may be a good time to shop for the best tech stocks to buy.Here are three for your consideration.Source: ThinkorSwimTech stocks like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) came roaring back yesterday. What I find particularly impressive is how Wednesday’s surge negated the massive support break from earlier in the month. The breakout has officially become a fakeout.With short-sellers now thoroughly scorched, ADBE stock could continue powering higher. In the short run, some backing and filling is likely, however. Adobe is up some 21% in the past six trading sessions and testing its falling 50-day moving average.Unless it falls back below $231, buyers deserve the benefit of the doubt.ADBE is slated to report earnings on Dec. 13.Source: ThinkorSwimOnce-loved semiconductor stocks quickly became loathed this fall. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares were demolished to the tune of 53% before finally finding a bottom.The price action over the past six weeks has been constructive. Both tests of the 200-day moving average were defended vigorously by bulls. And we now have a healthy base to launch from if AMD wants to reclaim its former glory. Resistance near $22 is the level to watch. A break above that will turn the daily trend higher.The cheap price tag and high implied volatility make AMD stock a prime naked put candidate. If you’re willing to bet it remains firm, then sell the Jan $17 put for 58 cents.Source: ThinkorSwimMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has exhibited relative strength throughout the turmoil, and it has held up much better than the FANG gang. Yesterday’s rally in MSFT stock places an exclamation point on its recent muscle-flexing by sending the stock back above its 50-day moving average amid heavy volume.At $111, MSFT remains a mere pebble toss from record highs. Like Adobe, Microsoft has risen considerably over the last six trading sessions (12%) so a pause or pullback could be in order before it revisits its prior peak of $116.18.Nonetheless, if you’re seeking one of the best stocks to buy, MSFT deserves your attention.Consider buying the Jan $110/$115 bull call spread for around $2.10.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn’t hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

But the economic undertow still is mostly pointed in the right direction.Economic growth continues to be robust, unemployment is lean and the Federal Reserve finally looks like it's at least considering a slightly dovish stance on interest rates. And while the Democratic takeover of the House had some investors worried about gridlock, some experts view it through bullish-tinted glasses.""We think markets likely view this outcome as positive since it removes the risk of an all-Democratic Congress,"" Evercore Managing Director Terry Haines told Bloomberg, ""and the increased Republican Senate majority offers additional assurance that the 2017 tax cuts would not be rolled back in 2021 in the event of a Democratic president.""In that light, it's easy to assume the best and start seeking out aggressive, high-growth, high-risk names. But it's incorrect to think only risky stocks are capable of producing strong growth. Sometimes big, well-established old-school names are surprisingly capable of putting up some big numbers, too: all the reward potential, with much less risk.Here are 12 top blue-chip stocks that still sport impressive growth and/or profit estimates - even against the backdrop of a (very) mature economic growth cycle.Getty ImagesMarket value: $33.7 billionDividend yield: 4.0%You wouldn't know it from the coverage of the recent oil-price downturn, but crude is actually still in a bullish uptrend in the medium-term. Ultimately, that should be beneficial for most of the sector, but some oil stocks are better positioned than others to ride an eventual return to the recovery.Stoyan Panayotov, CEO of California-based Babylon Wealth Management, thinks Valero Energy (VLO, $79.42) is one of those top prospects.""As the U.S. economy is running at full speed with the unemployment rate at 3.7% and small business confidence at an all-time high, Valero has reported an average quarterly revenue growth of 27%,"" he says.Analysts think Valero will post full-year sales growth of 23% for 2018, leading to a 28% improvement in the bottom line. Although revenue growth is expected to slow to just about 5% in 2019, there should be enough progress on the expense front to boost Valero's per-share earnings by just more than 50%, according to analyst estimates. The dividend now sits at a robust 4%, too.Getty ImagesMarket value: $18.2 billionDividend yield: N/AInvestors know Align Technology (ALGN, $235.59) better than they realize. This company makes and markets Invisalign dental braces, as well as a couple of other related products.Shareholders have had to deal with some drama of late. The company is preemptively combating a wave of patent expiration; about 40 expired in October, and an average of about two dozen more patents will expire every year through 2020.That sounds alarming, and Align Technology has indeed slowly seen new competitors tiptoe onto its turf now that doing so wouldn't create a legal liability. These rivals are a key part of why Align recently reeled in its growth outlook for the current quarter, sending the stock careening.Oddly enough, however, the proliferation of clear aligners and the subsequent price war may actually benefit ALGN. Invisalign still is the dominant name in the business, and the company has been able to leverage its name to take full advantage of the still-burgeoning clear braces market.Also, despite its lowered forecast, Align Technology still is growing like a weed. Fueled by projected 13% annual growth in the invisible orthodontics market through 2022, analysts still think Invisalign will grow sales 32% this year, then 23% in 2019.Getty ImagesMarket value: $192.3 billionDividend yield: 2.1%Most investors struggle to think months down the road, let alone years. It's not their fault - it's just the nature of the 24/7 news cycle that encourages constant trading activity. But if you can take a step back and look at the bigger picture, commercial jet maker Boeing (BA, $333.50) is positioned for lots of growth well beyond this year and next.An evolution is underway in the air-travel industry. The business is on the verge of becoming accessible enough and affordable enough for the vast majority of the world to enjoy it. Boeing's long-term outlook suggests demand for air travel will grow at an annualized clip of 4.7%, on average, through 2037. That growth should prompt the purchase of more than 42,000 new commercial jets - roughly twice the number actively used right now.As a result, the pros think Boeing's 2018 revenues will grow around 5%, then roughly 7% in 2019. That's not a lot, and certainly not enough to call it a ""red-hot growth estimate"" compared to other companies. But have a little perspective.The commercial jet sales cycle is a multiyear process. While Boeing's growth trajectory isn't electric, it's apt to be stable, reliable and persistent when so many companies are not. Morningstar Senior Equity Analyst Chris Higgins wrote after the company posted impressive third-quarter results, ""We believe Boeing's ability to generate returns above its cost of capital will remain strong well into the next decade and most likely beyond, given the nature of its moat sources combined with its large backlog.""If you need to see double-digit progress, look at the bottom line. Analysts expect Boeing's per-share earnings to improve by 47% year-over-year in 2018, then another 20% next year.Getty ImagesMarket value: $757.7 billionDividend yield: N/AShares of Alphabet (GOOGL, $1,091.79), the parent company of search engine Google, were rocked after the company reported third-quarter results in late October. Although earnings rolled in much higher than expected, revenue of $33.7 billion fell just a bit short of the $34.0 billion analysts were collectively expecting.Again, consider the bigger picture.Alphabet is no stranger to quarterly earnings misses, having come up short five times over the course of the past four years. Revenue hasn't always met analysts' high bar, either. But no one would want to stand in front of - or compete with - this growth machine, either. It's logged only one quarter of year-over-year revenue declines over the past decade. And while profit growth hasn't been quite as reliable, it's still just as impressive given the grand scheme of things.Google has its finger on the pulse of how and where consumers connect to the web - it's increasingly mobile - and continues to adapt accordingly. It's gotten very, very good at turning your devices into money.The pros still see breakneck growth, too. Alphabet's top line is expected to expand by 23% this year and 19% next. This is at a nearly $760 billion company.Getty ImagesMarket value: $13.9 billionDividend yield: 0.3%Fertilizer might be the least riveting industry represented in this look at growthy blue chips. There's only so much lipstick you can put on it. But Mosaic (MOS, $35.32) is sporting a surprisingly strong sales growth pace this year, which in turn is driving double-digit earnings growth for this year and probably next year as well.It's a cyclical business, but the fertilizer cycle isn't synced up with the overarching economic one. Rather, fertilizer prices are subject to forces such as the weather, stored-grain levels and, most recently, tariffs on farm-produced products.Right now, all those forces are collectively pushing fertilizer prices upward. Ammonia prices are at $497 per ton, up from 2017's multiyear low near $370. Urea prices have improved from 2017's low of $281 per ton to nearly $400. In both cases the recent strength snapped a multi-year downtrend, but there's still plenty of room for prices to keep rising before 2014's peak levels of $688 and $527, respectively, are tested.The tide has been strong enough to put Mosaic on pace to report full-year sales growth of 28%, which should be enough to boost the bottom line from last year's $1.09 per share to $1.92. While sales growth should taper off next year, earnings growth won't. Analysts are modeling a profit of $2.47 per share for 2019, up 29% from 2018's projection.Getty ImagesMarket value: $204.2 billionDividend yield: 0.5%As the lines between cash and credit card are blurred by the likes of PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), it would be easy to assume the traditional credit card middlemen are fighting a battle they'll ultimately lose.That's not the case at all. Not only is the iconic MasterCard (MA, $202.28) still more than relevant in today's payments marketplace, it's quite the innovator. The fintech stock operates an entire arm called MasterCard Labs devoted to, not surprisingly, the creation of new ways for consumers to make purchases and transfer funds. Some of the more recent innovations include a QR (quick response) based payment option for customers of Uganda's M-KOPA solar power provider, a contactless payment option for users of Garmin Pay's Maestro cardholders in Europe and a new patent that lays the groundwork for facilitating multiple transactions with just one blockchain thread.MasterCard is hardly a has-been.The proof is in the numbers. Thanks to the combination of MasterCard's iconic name and new technologies in the midst of a booming global economy, sales are on pace to grow nearly 20% this year, then 13% next year. Profits, meanwhile, should explode by 41% by 2018's end and improve by ""only"" 17% in 2019.Getty ImagesMarket value: $45.0 billionDividend yield: 0.6%It's been a trying past few years for health insurers. The prospect of the Affordable Care Act was enticing, but as most carriers soon realized, the plans offered through the ACA exchanges proved surprisingly costly to maintain. Many insurers have since backed away from so-called Obamacare plans, and though President Donald Trump's initial efforts looked like they might bring some relief, the White House hasn't been shy about making big, bold moves that impact the healthcare industry. For the first time ever, the Medicare program will be allowed to negotiate lower drug prices. Who knows what's next?Investors that can look past the cloud of dust, however, may realize that most health insurers have more to gain than to lose with pro-business Donald Trump calling the shots in the White House while the Democrats control the House of Representatives in an environment where everyone wants solutions. And, Humana (HUM, $328.90) is well-positioned to lead the charge of new winners. While the company's top line is likely to grow less than 5% this year when all is said and done, higher premiums and entry into new markets is expected to improve revenue by nearly 8% next year.Where the insurer is really expected to shine, though, is on the profit front. Analysts are indicating last year's bottom line of $11.71 per share will grow to $14.43 this year and reach $17.45 next year as Humana is able to pursue more profitable segments of the insurance market.Getty ImagesMarket value: $11.7 billionDividend yield: 0.9%Transportation companies have been the unsung heroes of the economic revival. From rail to air to road, the nation's renewed manufacturing machine has kept delivery drivers, pilots and train engineers busy.The country's trucking industry has arguably been pressured the most. Despite relatively good pay and rising freight rates, the lack of qualified truck drivers points to growing demand for tractor trailer transportation. The raw data does, too. The American Trucking Associations' Tonnage Index fell 0.8% in September, from August's levels, but was up 2.9% year-over-year. At 111.8, the ATA Tonnage Index is still near record levels.Shipping rates are ""definitely stabilizing,"" Avery Vise, vice president of trucking at research firm FTR, told The Wall Street Journal. His firm foresees ""a substantial deceleration of the year-over-year increases in those rates,"" making those costs ""more digestible for shippers."" The increase may not be abated just yet, however. Procter & Gamble (PG) CFO Jon Moeller commented during his company's most recent quarterly conference call, ""Trucking costs will likely be up 25% or more versus last year's inflated levels.""That leaves trucking firm J.B. Hunt (JBHT, $108.64) at least a few more quarters to capitalize on the trend. And even once freight prices stabilize, they'll be stabilizing at unusually high levels. Analysts believe J.B. Hunt's top-line growth of nearly 20% this year will drive a 51% improvement in per-share profits, while next year's expected 12% growth in revenue will boost the bottom line by nearly 19%.Getty ImagesMarket value: $57.8 billionDividend yield: 1.6%The so-called retail apocalypse may be in the rearview mirror, but it's certainly not miles behind. The dust still is settling, and the occasional retailer should still enter business relapse as internet-based shopping options continue to chip away.It's a perfect storm for off-price retailers, however, according to Federated Kaufmann Funds portfolio manager Barbara Miller. She says, ""As e-commerce takes market share of overall retail, new sources of close-out and cancelled orders emerge - off price channel is a logical clearance vehicle,"" pointing out how the ""off-price channel is a logical clearance vehicle.""One of her favorite picks from that segment of the retailing market is TJX Cos. (TJX, $47.85). Miller points out the company's ""iron-clad balance sheet"" and says the off-price venue still is ""taking share from department stores and other channels.""The past and projected profit numbers largely agree with her thesis. Sales are on pace to improve by 7% this year and slow to about 6% this year. But this year's per-share earnings growth will roll in around 24%, with next year's earnings profit expansion modeled between 7% and 10%.These numbers aren't great by most standards. But by retail standards, they're excellent.Getty ImagesMarket value: $121.2 billionDividend yield: N/AAdobe (ADBE, $249.21) shares trade at 74 times trailing 12-month earnings and 34 times next year's estimates. They're are anything but cheap. But this is a case where the steep premium might well be worth it. Revenue growth of more than 23% this year should persist, with projected sales growth of nearly 20% on the table for 2019. Next year's estimates indicate per-share profit growth of nearly 16%, and for the record, Adobe hasn't failed to top a quarterly earnings estimate in more than three years.It's an impressive outlook for a company best known for the Acrobat software that made online document-sharing viable, and a company that's almost as well known for its graphics software Photoshop.Alternatives to both, many of which are free, have been available for years. But Adobe is so much more than just Photoshop and Acrobat, and its business model has changed to reflect the current business environment.Adobe has spent the past several years building and buying business-oriented apps and platforms. Packaged under an umbrella called Experience Cloud, the company offers a variety of solutions ranging from consumer research to ad-campaign management to commerce, and more. There's nothing else out there quite like it.Better yet, the product is available in the format business users prefer. While still available as a one-time purchase, access to the Experience Cloud can also be ""rented"" online, which is a more cost-effective solution for many. More than half of the company's revenue is now recurring, and that source of Adobe's sales continues to expand.Getty ImagesMarket value: $60.1 billionDividend yield: 1.1%Once the undisputed king of online brokerage firms, Charles Schwab (SCHW, $45.66) has faced plenty of worthy competition in recent years. But Schwab has survived the collective efforts to topple it - and learned a few new tricks along the way.The evidence of this adept management is in the numbers. In an environment that wasn't exactly ideal for lenders and less than thrilling for traders, Schwab still found a way. Revenue is on pace to grow more than 17% this year, driving what should be an almost 50% increase in full-year earnings. In 2019, revenues will slow to just a bit more than 12% growth but still generate an 18% jump in per-share profits.Profits are improving enough to support a big buyback, which in turn has prompted a recent upgrade by Raymond James analyst Patrick O'Shaughnessy. He explains, ""Schwab has reached an inflection point that will result in substantially increased capital returns to shareholders."" Part of that capital return will materialize as the company deploys the $1 billion it has earmarked for stock buybacks. Another part will come in the form of greater dividends, which the company increased by 30% in July.In retrospect, the pullback from SCHW shares since May might not be fully merited.Getty ImagesMarket value: $48.5 billionDividend yield: 1.8%Farm machinery maker Deere (DE, $152.01) was supposed to be one of the first and biggest victims of the tariff war being waged between the U.S. and China. Not only did the raw materials that Deere needs to make equipment become much more expensive, but China also is a customer of the company's goods. If America made it more difficult for Deere to sell there, revenues would suffer.But if the tariff war is getting in the way of business, it hasn't shown up in the company's results yet. In the most recently reported quarter, Deere's earnings of $2.59 per share missed estimates of $2.75 by a relatively wide margin, but profits still were much better than the year-ago figure of $1.97. Net equipment sales were up 36% to $9.3 billion, too.Demand doesn't look like much of a problem, as raw economic strength and a solid agricultural market is more than able to offset any geopolitical hurdles.Analysts aren't seeing red flags on the horizon, either. Sales growth for the next two years of 7% and 4% aren't stellar, but they are supposed to drive what really matters - profits. The pros expect a 22% bump in earnings this year, then 12% next.EDITOR'S PICKSCopyright 2018 The Kiplinger Washington Editors"
ADBE,11-29-2018 06:08PM,Amazon Boosts Satellite Initiatives With Lockheed Martin Deal,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-boosts-satellite-initiatives-lockheed-151603971.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Amazon’s AMZN strong efforts toward innovation of its cloud services driven by strategic partnerships are strengthening its presence in the global cloud market.The company’s cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) has extended its tie up with Lockheed Martin LMT to expand reach in satellite data.The deal enables AWS to introduce a new antenna service to its platform by combining its recently launched AWS Ground Station service with Lockheed Martin’s Verge antenna network.Partnership to BenefitNotably, the latest partnership is a win-win situation for both the companies.The integrated solution will enable the AWS customers to download data from multiple satellites at a single point of time with the help of Verge. With this, AWS will facilitate the accessibility of crucial satellite data.Further, customers of Lockheed Martin which primarily comprise satellite operators will be able to upload their data with the aid of AWS Ground Station, consequently integrating massive satellite data with the AWS services.We believe the two-way benefits are likely to accelerate the adoption of AWS Ground Station.Further, the move will enable AWS to provide low latency to its customers for processing the satellite data, backed by AWS Ground Station antennas that are co-located with AWS Regions. This will also provide access to other AWS services in this regard.Additionally, the latest move will aid Amazon in gaining traction among the satellite operators, government organizations and clients in highly regulated industries.All these factors are likely to drive the top-line growth of high-margin generating AWS. Notably, AWS revenues surged 45.7% year over year to $6.68 billion in third-quarter 2018.Coming to the price performance, shares of Amazon have returned 43.5% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 4.9%.Deepening Focus Toward Satellite & SpaceAWS has been eyeing the satellite and space area for quite some time now in a bid to explore the opportunities of space. Per Reuters, the company intends to utilize its 12 antennas in direct transmission of data from satellites to its data centers. This is in sync with its latest move.Apart from this, Amazon is in talks with the president of Chile to house and mine astrodata from Chile’s giant telescopes. Moreover, Amazon hosts cloud platform for the Hubble Telescope’s data and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Australia.Further, AWS won a contract from Iridium Communications IRDM to develop a satellite-based network called CloudConnect for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Notably, this has provided an opportunity for AWS to develop satellite-based cloud applications.Moreover, the company is aggressively looking to hire people who can work on its new space and satellite initiative, namely interconnecting space system networks.Notably, these robust endeavors are likely to strengthen the AWS’ services portfolio which in turn will aid its dominant position in the cloud market.Amazon.com, Inc.

VMW jumped nearly 5% during regular trading Wednesday. So, should investors expect the business-focused cloud computing firm to post strong Q3 financial results Thursday, or did VMW stock get a boost from its peer Salesforce’s CRM strong quarterly performance?Cloud-based customer relationship management power Salesforce saw its stock price soar over 10% Wednesday after it reported its Q3 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. The company’s earnings blew away our Zacks Consensus Estimate and its sales climbed 26% from the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, VMware has seen its stock price surge over 17% in the last month as the broader market moved mostly sideways. Shares of VMware closed regular trading Wednesday at $159.76 per share, which marked a roughly 3% decline from its 52-week high $165.00 per share.Jumping back a bit further, we can see that shares of VMW have outpaced its industry over the past two years. Plus, VMware stock has topped its peer group over this stretch, which includes the likes of Adobe ADBE and Oracle ORCL.VMware’s Q3 revenues are projected to climb 9.7% to reach $2.17 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. The Palo Alto-based tech company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to jump 11.9% to $1.50 per share. Yet, we still need to know how likely it is that VMware can top our quarterly earnings estimates.Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to help us. The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.VMware is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This, unfortunately, means that our model is inconclusive. Yet, investors should note that the company has topped our quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing four periods.VMware is set to release its third quarter financial results after the market closes on Thursday.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

ADBE,11-27-2018 06:08PM,"Black Friday, Cyber Monday Set E-Commerce Sales Records",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/black-friday-cyber-monday-set-102800080.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Holiday shopping creep hasn't hurt Black Friday or Cyber Monday -- at least, not when it comes to online sales. Though many retailers now begin offering their seasonal sales on Nov. 1, consumers continue to spend big during the traditional Thanksgiving-weekend surge.Preliminary data from Adobe's (NASDAQ: ADBE) Digital Insights showed that all three major shopping days saw large increases in digital sales  compared to last year. The rush to buy began on Thanksgiving, then really took hold with a strong Black Friday, according to Adobe Digital Insights Director Taylor Schreiner.""Black Friday will come very close to eclipsing last year's Cyber Monday in terms of online sales,"" he said in a press release. ""...While some Americans might have been waiting in lines at stores today, the data suggests that at least some of them joined their peers in shopping on their phones -- and buying more than they did in years past.""All three major shopping days showed e-commerce sales growth this month. Image source: Getty Images.It's important to remember that e-commerce sales are growing -- and will almost certainly post bigger gains than brick-and-mortar sales during this year's holiday shopping season -- but they're still only about 19% of the total. Digital sales for the final two months of the year are expected to rise about 15% in 2018, according to Adobe data, to $124.1 billion. Total holiday season sales are forecast to land between $717 billion and 720.89 billion, according to pre-holiday season projections from the National Retail Federation.The Adobe numbers, however, show that digital sales growth exceeded that 15% overall forecast and topped the specific projections for all three key shopping days: Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday. Thanksgiving digital sales came in at $3.7 billion, up 27.9% over 2017. Black Friday sales hit $6.2 billion, up 23.6% year over year, and Cyber Monday's sales grew by 19.3% to $7.9 billion.In addition, sales from Nov. 1 through Nov. 26 were $58.52 billion, up from $50.1 billion for the same period in 2017. That's about $1.3 billion ahead of Adobe's predictions.Some of that $1.3 billion likely came from brick-and-mortar retailers' e-commerce operations, though it's possible that sales at physical stores beat expectations as well. The reality is that while (mostly) pure digital Amazon probably gained at the expense of traditional stores, the big retail winners are the ones that have embraced an omnichannel model. That's backed up by Adobe's data.Buy online, pickup in-store over the weekend saw a record 50% percent increase year over year. As the online and offline retail experience continues to blend, retailers with physical stores drove 28% higher conversions online.The retail losers are those chains that have yet to adapt. Consumers have become accustomed to getting what they want, precisely when and where they want it. More and more often, that means they demand the ability to order online and pickup in-store, or shop in a brick-and-mortar store for home delivery, or use some other non-traditional method.The growth of digital sales is almost certainly going to leave many retailers who have clung to an outdated physical-first model falling further behind. That long-term trend shows no signs of slowing -- but it doesn't mean brick-and-mortar stores will disappear. Instead, the deeper patterns show an evolution taking place, with retailers' physical locations becoming part store, part showroom, part shipping warehouse, and part customer service center.More From The Motley FoolJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

(Ben Garver/The Berkshire Eagle via AP)NEW YORK (AP) -- The holiday shopping season has gotten off to a ""very strong"" start, according to the largest U.S. retail trade group.The National Retail Federation said Tuesday that consumer spending has been strong, fueled by a better economy and stores' investments in online services including features that allow shoppers to buy online and pick up the items at the store.The trade group's assessment comes even after a survey of more than 3,000 shoppers Thanksgiving and Friday forecast that fewer people would turn out for the five-day weekend that ended Monday, compared to a year ago.This year, there were more than 165 million people who shopped online or in stores from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, based on survey results. Last year, that figure was 174 million. The retail group attributed the drop to stores spreading out their deals beyond the Black Friday weekend.""This was a very strong holiday weekend,"" said Bill Thorne, a spokesman at the trade group.The group now says it expects sales for November and December will be at the high end of its earlier forecast of a 4.3 to 4.8 percent rise. That would be below last year's 5.3 percent increase but well above the average annual increase of 3.9 percent of the past five years.Meanwhile, Adobe Analytics, which tracks online spending, said that Cyber Monday was expected to have hit $7.9 billion, up 19.7 percent from last year.Thanksgiving Day generated $3.7 billion in online spending, up 28 percent, while Black Friday brought in $6.2 billion, a 23.6 percent increase from a year ago, according to Adobe.Mobile devices accounted for 51.4 percent of site visits and 34 percent of revenue on Cyber Monday. So far, the period from Nov. 1 through Monday has generated online sales of $58.5 billion, up 19.9 percent, Adobe said."

ADBE,11-27-2018 06:08PM,Upbeat Sentiment On Retail Wanes After Trump Comments On Trade,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upbeat-sentiment-retail-wanes-trump-154434809.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The up and down of the market so far this week seems to have been a tale of two types of trade.Excitement about a potentially bumper holiday shopping season goosingdomestic trade at retailers helped spark a rally yesterday. But the mood seems more somber this morning as tensions about trade between the United States and China have come back to the forefront.President Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that it was “highly unlikely” that he would grant a Chinese request to hold off on raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent from the current 10 percent. He also reiterated his threat to put duties on the rest of Chinese imports not currently subject to tariffs, the newspaper reported.If the U.S. goes ahead with the tariffs on additional goods, Trump said Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones and laptops imported from China could be subject to duties, the newspaper reported. That news comes on the back of already existing concerns about iPhone sales. AAPL shares were down more than 1.8 percent in pre-market trading.Trump’s comments are the latest salvo in a trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies that has dragged on for months and fueled worries about global economic growth. Those fears have helped put downward pressure on both the equities market and oil prices in recent days.Oil is down again this morning, and with the substantial declines in prices recently, it might be worth watching to see if Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell makes any mention of the fall in crude in a speech Wednesday or if central bankers mention falling prices in minutes scheduled for release the same day. It’s possible that Wall Street could interpret mention of falling oil prices as a dovish sign from the central bank.Retail-Fueled GainsOn Monday, the shopping wasn’t confined to just online retailers. Bargain hunters seemed to be buying in the stock market too. Every S&P 500 (SPX) sector closed in the green yesterday, led by consumer discretionary stocks as investors appeared to be positive on the sector as post-Thanksgiving sales continued into Cyber Monday.According to a late-morning press release yesterday, Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ: ADBE) was projecting that spending on Cyber Monday would hit $7.9 billion by the end of the day to make it the biggest U.S. online shopping day in history.Despite steep online competition, brick-and-mortar isn’t dead. On Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, shopper visits to traditional retail stores declined just 1 percent for the combined two-day period compared to last year. On Black Friday alone, there was a 1.7 percent drop in traffic versus 2017, according to ShopperTrak. “The fact that the combined shopper visits remained almost the same this year compared to the last three years proves that the notion of Black Friday not being popular anymore is a myth,” Brian Field, senior director of global retail consulting for ShopperTrak, said in a press release. “Based on the Black Friday traffic data, retailers are in for a successful holiday season.”With retailers racking up sales online and in stores, it perhaps wasn’t surprising to see the consumer discretionary sector up nearly 2.6 percent, leading the other 10 S&P 500 sectors in percentage gains.Tech, Oil Bounce TooInformation technology shares took the runner-up ribbon for gains Monday, helped by bounces in Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), AAPL, and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).Yesterday’s bounce in tech shares, and the wider U.S. market, after last week’s selling may also have to do with some bargain hunting as investors appear to be trying to get a feel for whether the overall downward bias in stocks may be coming to an end.Stocks weren’t the only asset to bounce on Monday. Oil prices also rose. The bounce may have been helped by bargain hunting and by a seemingly more favorable attitude toward assets perceived to be riskier. U.S. government bond yields rose as investors apparently exited Treasuries as the perceived need for more defensive assets waned. Wall Street’s fear barometer, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), dropped.But uncertainty doesn’t seem to have fully left the market, as the VIX remains elevated. It’s been bouncing around the 20 mark of late, which is higher than what we’ve seen for much of this year but is in the ballpark of historical norms. Although it fell yesterday, with tensions about trade heading into the G20 meeting, it might not be surprising to see it inch back up.Figure 1: Nearing a Bottom? There has been plenty of selling in the stock market in recent weeks, as shown by this chart of the S&P 500. CFRA, an investment research firm, thinks the selling may be nearing a conclusion (see below.) Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Selling Seen Near ConclusionThe current stock market selloff may be nearing a conclusion, investment research firm CFRA said in a note on Monday. Based on the average next-12-months price-to-earnings ratio for the five most recent market declines in excess of 5 percent, the S&P 500 would need to fall just 1.4 percent more from last week’s close to bottom around 2596. But if the market needs to fall to the average P/E ratio from the last 10 market declines before bottoming, the index would have to fall to 2321. “The magnitude of the ultimate decline will largely reflect the consensus conclusion surrounding the ongoing trade dispute, which represents the keystone in this arch of agita,” the firm said. “At CFRA, we don’t see a recession on the horizon and think there is a very good chance that this selloff is near its conclusion.”Second Q3 GDP EstimateTomorrow, the government takes its second swing at gross domestic product numbers, with its second estimate of Q3 GDP. The figures are expected to show robust annualized growth of 3.6 percent, according to a Briefing.com consensus. That would be slightly ahead of the 3.5 percent recorded in the first estimate, so it probably wouldn’t be enough to sway the Fed’s thinking on the pace of economic growth and the potential need to rein it in with more hawkish policy. But it may be worth watching for whether the number comes in ahead of expectations or if the prior reading is revised substantially higher. If either of those two scenarios occurs, it could weigh on stocks as investors might worry that the Fed might act more aggressively to keep the economy from overheating.Bright Spot for HousingIf you were like many on Wednesday and focused on heading out for the Thanksgiving holiday, you could be forgiven if you missed some news from the housing market. There’s been a drum beat of less-than-stellar housing news in recent days, so Wednesday’s better-than-expected existing home sales data for October may have come as a welcome surprise. Sales rose month-over-month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.22 million, beating the Breifing.com consensus expectation of 5.2 million. But the housing market isn’t out of the woods, as “even with the October increase, the level of sales remains at levels from late 2016 as higher mortgage rates and a limited supply of lower-priced homes weigh,” Briefing.com said.Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

This will assist the developers in building, running and deployment of their robotics applications.RoboMaker aids in on-demand testing of application by enabling seamless multiple parallel simulations with racing tracks, indoor rooms and department stores. AWS ensures robot’s functionalities like streaming data, learning, communicating and navigating by integrating its new service with other services like machine learning (ML), monitoring, and analytics services.Apart from these, AWS’ latest robotics service offers fleet management solution for remote applications by assimilating AWS Greengrass. It also supports over-the-air (OTA) deployment of robotics applications.Amazon cloud services portfolio has expanded with the new service launch. Moreover, RoboMaker will aid AWS in gaining traction among the robotic application developers. This bodes well for the company’s cloud customer base.Robotics Holds PromiseThe latest move of Amazon enables the company to make its foray into Robotics as a Service (RaaS) market. Growing demand of robots in household, office and warehouse in order to simplify and facilitate work in this fast-paced world endows this market with immense potential.Per a report from Research and Markets, the global RaaS market is expected to witness a CAGR of 19.73% between 2018 and 2022.We believe AWS is well poised to reap benefits from this rapidly growing market with the support of RoboMaker and its robust features.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM)Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteGaining Competitive EdgeThe latest move of the company provides it with competitive advantage against other big cloud players in the market such as Microsoft’s MSFT Azure and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud.Although Azure has a partnership with SoftBank Robotics Corporation with the help of which it is working on the development of next-generation cloud-enabled robot by utilizing its IoT Suite and SoftBank’s humanoid robot, Pepper. However, the company lacks a constructive robotic service like RoboMaker.Meanwhile, Google is gaining steam in RaaS space with its strengthening artificial intelligence (AI) skills, ML techniques, data management capabilities and cloud services.The search giant is set to launch Google Cloud Robotics Platform in 2019 for the robotics application developers.Nevertheless, the latest move of AWS gives Amazon the first mover advantage. Further, the service has already gained traction among few companies namely Stanley Black & Decker, Robot Care System, Open Robotics and FIRST.All these are likely to aid the dominance of AWS in the cloud market worldwide.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector that can be considered is Adobe Systems ADBE which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Long-term earnings growth rate for Adobe Systems is currently pegged at 16.4%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

ADBE,11-27-2018 06:08PM,"Market Morning: Futures Down, Cyber Monday Blowout, Ma Joins Communists Honoring Capitalists",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-morning-futures-down-cyber-134026388.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Volatility Continues As Futures Back Down AgainIt’s two steps forward and three steps back as the decline continues. After yesterday’s rally of over 1.5% in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), futures are back down again moderately about 0.4%. The Nasdaq is down in the premarket a little heavier at 0.6% and oil is flat at around $51. Europe is down slightly and Asian stocks are moderately higher, Japan up but China flat. Bond yields are mostly steady while the cryptocurrency market has stabilized for the day. It looks like it may actually be a calm day, relatively, in the capital markets. Enjoy it while you can. Take a breath or two, but not three. That might take too long.Cyber Monday Brings In Nearly $8B in SalesCyber Monday in the United States was a big hit, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) saying it was the biggest sales day in the company’s history. Interesting to see how the stock will respond to such news, but so far investors don’t seem to care, as Amazon is down about 1% in premarket trading. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) underestimated sales by about $100M, and across the board, company’s Cyber Monday sales were about 20% higher than last year. However, it wasn’t all positive. Shoppers were complaining about getting inundated with way too many promotional emails. Will one day of sales turn around the slumping American economy? Wait a month or two and find out.Alibaba’s Ma Joins Communist Party At Ceremony Honoring CapitalismChina’s biggest company with or without a middle eastern name, Alibaba’s (NYSE:BABA) CEO Jack Ma has joined the People’s Republic’s Communist Party. Honored at a ceremony ironically marking 40 years since the country’s opening up economically and basically eschewing communist policies after the death of Mao Zedung, Ma was among 100 business leaders honored for being successful capitalists by the Communist Party’s central committee, which as of now likes business activity, but who knows what will happen if and when things turn sour. By joining the party, Ma may be implicitly looking for special treatment or at least less harassment by the political establishment in China.Trump “Unlikely” To Scrap Tariff Plan on $200B in Chinese GoodsSpeaking of China, President Trump has said that it is “highly unlikely” that he would accept a request by China’s Communist Party Leader Xi Jinping to delay tariffs in the name of capitalism. “If we don’t make a deal, then I’m going to put the $267 billion additional on,” at a tariff rate of either 10% or 25%, Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Tariffs are set to rise on $200B in Chinese goods starting January 1st to 25%, up from the current 10%. “What I’d advise is for them to build factories in the United States and to make the product here,” he said. Trump didn’t mention that making products in the United States would increase labor costs significantly, making doing so impossible, which is why companies outsource labor to China in the first place. Perhaps Xi will try to encourage Trump to open up the United States to labor competition by getting rid of the regulations and minimum wage laws and insurance mandates that make American labor noncompetitive, but this is also highly unlikely.General Motors Tries To Save Itself, Government Cries FoulGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is planning to idle factories and cut jobs, as all business do when they need to conserve capital, but the US government is having none of it, complaining that they should be consulted about business decisions. Plants in Ohio, Michigan, and Canada are scheduled to be idled in the move. GM has been feeling the crunch of rising interest rates that have affected its auto loan sector. As long as rates keep rising, GM will keep struggling in this regard, and may have to shut off even more production in the near future to stay healthy, though government officials will keep complaining loudly.The post Market Morning: Futures Down, Cyber Monday Blowout, Ma Joins Communists Honoring Capitalists appeared first on Market Exclusive."
BABA,12-03-2018 12:08PM,7 Beaten-Down Chinese Stocks Ready to Rebound,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-beaten-down-chinese-stocks-203209607.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Over the past several months, investors have thrown Chinese stocks in the garbage pile, and they haven’t once second guessed it. This is particularly true for Chinese tech stocks. The Invesco China Technology ETF (NYSE:CQQQ) peaked in January. Since then, it has dropped more than 30%, indicative of what has been a broad and relentless selloff in Chinese stocks.But, this selloff could be coming to an end soon. After all, the long-term fundamentals underlying many of these big growth Chinese tech names still remain very strong. China’s consumer class continues to urbanize and digitize at a rapid rate, and the size of this class is unprecedented. Thus, the long-term implications of more widespread phone usage, e-shopping, digital advertising, traveling, so on and so forth, are quite large.But, the market has ignored those long-term growth fundamentals for almost all of 2018. Instead, the market has chosen to focus on a weak broader economic backdrop, which has been dragged down by escalating U.S. and China trade tensions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThose tensions are finally deescalating. Over the weekend, the two countries agreed to a 90-day trade truce that will allow for further discussions and negotiations. While this isn’t a resolution, it is a step toward resolution and a step toward Chinese stocks rebounding.With that in mind, here’s a list of seven Chinese stocks, which, once all this trade noise clears up, should rebound in a big way.Source: ShutterstockThe Fundamentals: China’s most well-known and biggest tech company, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is supported by big growth fundamentals that imply a healthy long-term growth trajectory for this company and stock. Last quarter, core commerce revenues grew by over 50% yet again, while cloud computing revenues rose 90%. Margins took a hit, but that compression is all tied to growth-related investments and will inevitably phase out over time. Thus, in the big picture, the fundamentals here remain strong, supported by the continued urbanization and digitization of China’s economy.The Valuation: Following the recent dip in BABA stock, this stock now trades at just 24X forward earnings. That is low both for this stock and relative to the company’s 50%-plus revenue growth rates.The Technicals: BABA stock seems to have bottomed in late November around $130. It has been on an uptrend ever since, and should remain on this uptrend so long as trade war concerns remain muted.Source: ShutterstockThe Fundamentals: Often considered the Twiter (NYSE:TWTR) of China, Chinese social communication app Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) is supported by healthy long-term growth fundamentals. The platform now has nearly 450 million users, making it one of the largest social media platforms in the world. Weibo is also adding users at a fairly consistent 70 million new users per year rate. Revenue growth is running in excess of 40%. Margins are stable. And, those numbers will only get better as China’s digital advertising landscape matures. Overall, there’s a lot to like here.The Valuation: Perhaps the best thing to like about WB stock is the valuation. This stock trades at just 20X forward earnings. That is an anemic valuation for a 40%-plus revenue growth company with a rapidly growing user base and stable margins.The Technicals: WB stock has been in a huge downtrend for the past several months. But, the stock has shown strong support in the mid-$50’s, and it is now rallying in a big way off that level. This rally should persist so long as U.S. and China trade relations improve.Source: ShutterstockThe Fundamentals: Chinese internet giant Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is supported by robust long-term growth fundamentals that are perhaps second to only Alibaba. From head to toe, Tencent is the Chinese internet. The company operates the country’s largest social media platforms (one of which is the only billion user platform in China). Tencent is also the gaming giant in China, and owns China’s biggest digital video, news, music and literature platforms. Tencent also operates China’s largest mobile payment platform and the country’s largest mobile security network. Thus, Tencent is the Chinese internet. So long as internet usage in China picks up (which it inevitably will), Tencent will grow at a healthy rate.The Valuation: The valuation on TCEHY stock is fairly attractive at just over 30X this year’s earnings estimate. But, margins have been a major headwind for this company, and until that headwind clears up, valuation will be capped.The Technicals: Despite a long-term downtrend, TCEHY stock has found solid support over the past few months in the lower $30’s. Now, the stock is bouncing strongly off those levels, and rallying to levels not seen since late September. This uptrend looks strong, and should last so long as broad China economic sentiment improves.Source: ShutterstockThe Fundamentals: Chinese internet search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is, for all intents and purposes, the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of China. This positioning guarantees Baidu healthy long-term growth potential so long as internet usage and digital advertising in China accelerate higher, two things, which seem certain at this point in time. Moreover, Baidu has high-growth potential through its cloud, IoT and AI businesses, the sum of which are still in the early stages of potentially explosive growth trajectories.The Valuation: BIDU stock is pretty cheap at under 20X forward earnings for what was 27% revenue growth last quarter. Falling margins are behind the low valuation. But, this is a near-term phenomena. Huge losses at iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) and big investments into the app ecosystem are dragging on margins. Eventually, those margin headwinds will fade out. Once they do, today’s valuation will seem anemic.The Technicals: Much like other Chinese stocks, BIDU has been on a big downtrend for the past several months. But, this stock has shown strong support multiple times around the $180 level. Today, the stock is comfortably above that level, implying that a bottom has been put in and that this stock is ready to start heading higher again.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrThe Fundamentals: Alibaba isn’t the only e-commerce player in the Chinese market. The other big player here is JD (NASDAQ:JD). Much like Alibaba, JD is a big-growth e-commerce company with secular growth tailwinds through the urbanization and digitization of China’s consumer economy. Revenue growth is cooling at JD because of slower economic growth (25% revenue growth last quarter versus 40% growth in the year-ago quarter). Margins are also dropping. But, despite near-term choppiness, the fundamentals of this company, through continued robust e-commerce growth in China, remain favorable.The Valuation: JD stock trades at just 0.5X trailing sales. That is a really low sales multiple. It strongly implies that both revenue growth will continue to slow and that margins will continue to compress. But, if China’s economy improves from here due to de-escalating trade war tensions, JD’s revenue growth will re-accelerate and margins will stabilize, thus making the current valuation seem too low.The Technicals: JD stock has been one of the biggest losers in the Chinese stock rout. But, the stock is bouncing nicely off of the critical $20 level amid improving macroeconomic conditions, a dynamic that implies that this stock may have found a bottom.Source: Thomas Galvez via FlickrThe Fundamentals: Perhaps the most underrated Chinese tech stock is China’s go-to online travel site, Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP). While Alibaba, JD and Baidu get all the market attention, Ctrip is a company that is supported by just as strong, if not stronger, underlying fundamentals. Often called the Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) of China, Ctrip has been a big winner over the past several years as China’s rising consumer class has finally embraced air travel. Although this China air travel growth narrative has hit a few road-bumps in 2018 due to slowing China economic growth, the long-term outlook for Ctrip remains favorable. Just 7% of Chinese citizens have a passport, versus 40% in America. Because of this discrepancy, the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute (COTRI) predicts that Chinese overseas trips will grow from 145 million last year, to over 400 million by 2030.The Valuation: CTRP stock is still expensive relative to its peers, trading at nearly 30 forward earnings. But, that valuation is warranted given the China air travel industry’s strong long-term fundamentals, and the lack of competition that Ctrip has in that burgeoning industry.The Technicals: From June to November, CTRP stock dropped from $50 to $25. But, after a big post-earnings collapse in early November, CTRP stock has rebounded strongly, implying that those early November lows may have been a bottom for the stock.Source: ShutterstockThe Fundamentals: Another underrated gem in the Chinese tech stock group is video streaming platform Huya (NASDAQ:HUYA). Much like Ctrip, this company doesn’t get much mainstream media attention. But, also like Ctrip, Huya is supported by exceptionally favorable long-term growth fundamentals. Across the globe, live streaming video game viewership numbers are skyrocketing higher as consumers look for alternative entertainment options. The biggest market for video game streaming? China, with $32.2 billion in gaming revenues in 2017. The fastest growing market? China, with a projected 13% compounded annual revenue growth rate over the next five years. The biggest player in the Chinese market? Huya, with nearly 50% market share. Consequently, Huya has huge long-term growth prospects through the mainstream proliferation of esports and live video game streaming in China.The Valuation: HUYA stock is expensive. The stock trades at over 6X trailing sales. But, Huya is in the category of streaming. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the leader in this category, and that stock trades at nearly 9X trailing sales. Thus, if Huya realizes its long-term potential as a major streaming player on the video game side, today’s valuation will ultimately prove to be exceptionally conservative.The Technicals: Unlike other Chinese stocks on this list, HUYA stock hasn’t found a bottom yet. This stock continues to drop and act like a falling knife. Thus, there isn’t really anything here for technical and/or momentum investors to hang their hat on, and that could prove to be a headwind for this stock in the near term.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA, TWTR, WB, BIDU, GOOG, CTRP and NFLX.Compare BrokersThe post 7 Beaten-Down Chinese Stocks Ready to Rebound appeared first on InvestorPlace."
BABA,12-03-2018 12:08PM,10 Stocks to Buy With The Trade War on Pause,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-buy-trade-war-201917325.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Since early October, the broader markets have been spiraling downward on concerns that more rate hikes and bigger tariffs would create a material drag on global economic growth. But over the past two weeks, those two major concerns have significantly receded, leaving some investors seeking out stocks to buy once more.Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sounded a surprisingly dovish tone in a well-watched speech, with the broad implication being that there are only a few rate hikes left in the pipeline. Stocks jumped higher after that speech. Meanwhile, over the weekend, the U.S. and China came to a truce and agreed to a 90-day pause in the current trade war. Stocks jumped in response to that news, too.Overall, the two major headwinds which have been dragging on markets since October are now significantly receding. That means it’s time to start getting bullish again, especially on the names that have been significantly weighed by the rate hike and trade war headwinds.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, I ran a piece on 10 stocks to buy for a rate hike slowdown. This week, it’s time to look at 10 stocks to buy with the trade war on pause.Source: ShutterstockPercent Off All-Time High: 21%Why It Has Been Killed: China e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has dropped into bear market territory quite simply because it is China’s e-commerce giant. Trade war tensions with the U.S. have created economic uncertainty in China. That uncertainty is starting to show up in slower growth and output. Granted, the Chinese economy is still growing at a 6%-plus clip, but growth is showing a disheartening slowing trend which has kept investor enthusiasm checked. Alibaba, as the heartbeat of the Chinese economy, has suffered during this slowdown, too.Why It Will Bounce Back: Alibaba stock should rebound now that the trade war is on pause because that has been this stock’s single largest headwind. Outside of trade war noise, Alibaba has continued to report really strong numbers. Core commerce revenue growth last quarter was in excess of 50%. Cloud computing growth was 90%. Customer growth was robust, and while margins continued to struggle, that is just a near-term phenomena that is the consequence of growth-related investments. Overall, the growth story supporting Alibaba stock remains robust, so with its biggest headwind now on pause, this stock should rebound from its 20%-plus sell-off.Source: ShutterstockPercent Off All-Time High: 21%Why It Has Been Killed: Consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost its position as the most valuable company in the world over the past month as trade war headwinds have weighed on operations. Namely, iPhone demand this year is reportedly weak, especially abroad, and that is presumably a consequence of trade war friction. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump flirted with the idea of slapping tariffs on iPhones, a move which could further dampen demand through higher costs. Overall, the trade war has really struck Apple where it hurts: in the iPhone business.Why It Will Bounce Back: Apple stock should be able to rebound with the trade war on pause because, outside of trade war headwinds, the Apple growth narrative remains robust thanks to strong new hardware and software growth. The big problem with Apple has been iPhone demand issues, and those issues stem in part from trade war noise.With the outlook on those issues improving, investors will take a more bullish stance on the now very cheap Apple stock (12 forward earnings), and this stock should rebound strongly.Source: ShutterstockPercent Off All-Time High: 10%Why It Has Been Killed: The world’s largest retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has struggled over the past few months thanks to both rate hike and trade war concerns. On the rate hike front, investors were worried that higher rates would sap consumer enthusiasm and result in a retail sales slowdown that would ultimately drag on Walmart’s revenue numbers. On the trade war front, investors were worried that bigger tariffs would cause Walmart’s input costs to go up and ultimately drag on Walmart’s margins.Why It Will Bounce Back: The rate hike issue was cleared up last week, and Walmart stock bounced back. Now, the trade war issue is being cleared up this week, at least temporarily, and Walmart stock is again rallying. This rally should persist. Walmart is reporting its best numbers in over a decade right now against the backdrop of a U.S. consumer that is as strong as he/she has been since the Recession. Given those operating fundamentals, Walmart stock deserves to trade at all-time highs. The stock is still 10% off those levels. Thus, as trade war and rate hike headwinds move into the rear-view mirror, this stock should continue rallying.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Percent Off All-Time High: 20%Why It Has Been Killed: The same things that have weighed on Walmart over the past two month have weighed on Target (NYSE:TGT). Higher rates threaten the underlying healthy of the U.S. consumer, while bigger tariffs threaten Target’s margins. Put those two concerns together in a market obsessed with a looming recession and you get a stock that has dropped 20% in a hurry.Why It Will Bounce Back: Target stock will rebound for the same reasons that Walmart stock will rebound. Remove the trade war and rate hike headwinds from this company’s fundamentals, and it’s tough to find anything wrong. Comparable sales and traffic growth are running at decade-high levels. The digital business has gone from zero to hero, and is growing at a near 50% clip. Margins are stabilizing. And, the early read on Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales is quite strong.Overall, there’s a lot to like about Target. Thus, with rate hike and trade war headwinds regressing, this stock will bounce back from its recent sell-off.Source: Anthony via FlickrPercent Off All-Time High: 18%Why It Has Been Killed: Industrial giant Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is often viewed as the heartbeat of the global economy. As goes the global economy, so goes Caterpillar. Thus, as the global economic outlook has substantially weakened over the past two months due to rate hike and trade war headwinds, Caterpillar stock has struggled.Why It Will Bounce Back: The numbers at Caterpillar remain pretty good. Last quarter, revenues rose 18% and the company reported its best third-quarter profit per share in company history. Thus, the recent sell off has nothing to do with what has happened, but rather everything to do with fears over what will happen. With trade war and rate hike headwinds retreating, the outlook for what will happen in the global economy over the next several quarters is dramatically improving. As that outlook improves, CAT stock should rebound.Source: Mike Seyfang via FlickrPercent Off All Time High: 15%Why It Has Been Killed: E-commerce and cloud giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was once the symbol of unstoppable growth in the stock market. But that has changed over the past few months as the company’s e-commerce business has dramatically slowed, especially on the international front (just 13% growth last quarter, versus 29% growth in the year ago quarter). This massive slowdown has a lot to do with trade war friction dampening global economic health, and thus, the trade war has been a big drag on Amazon stock.Why It Will Bounce Back: Everywhere else you look at Amazon, there is still a lot to like. Margins are heading higher. The cloud business is still growing at a 40%-plus clip. The digital ad business is still growing at a 100%-plus clip. Moreover, the company is making big moves into offline retail and pharma, both of which constitute huge opportunities for Amazon. Thus, the only thing not to like is the slowing growth trend in the international retail business.Retreating trade war headwinds will improve the outlook for that business to rebound. As that outlook improves, Amazon stock should bounce back because of robust firepower in all its other growth segments.Source: ShutterstockPercent Off All-Time High: 5%Why It Has Been Killed: Leading electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has actually performed much better than peers on this list during recent stock market volatility. A lot of this has to do with Model 3 production ramp in the United States and the fact that the company showed a sizable profit last quarter. But Tesla stock still isn’t at all-time highs, and perhaps the biggest reason why it isn’t is because of struggles in China, where tariffs have reportedly created a huge sales decline.Why It Will Bounce Back: For all intents and purposes, Tesla stock should trade at all-time highs right now. The company’s fundamentals have never been better. Model 3 production is ramping to mass market levels. Gross margins across the board are improving, and the company is finally starting to benefit from opex leverage, implying sustained and growing profits going forward. Meanwhile, all signs point to this company rapidly stealing market share from peers. The only thing holding this stock back is tariff concerns. But, those tariffs are coming down, and as they do, Tesla stock should go up.Source: ShutterstockPercent Off All-Time High: 75%Why It Has Been Killed: Auto giant Ford (NYSE:F) has been a losing stock for a long time, but the stock’s retreat has accelerated recently as rate hike and trade war headwinds have picked up. The auto industry is one of the most rate sensitive sectors of the economy. Thus, as rates have gradually gone up over the past several quarters, auto demand has cooled. Meanwhile, the auto industry is also one of the most trade-sensitive sectors of the economy. Thus, as trade tensions have escalated over the past several quarters, Ford’s China business has entirely fallen apart.Why It Will Bounce Back: There won’t be any revival in Ford that boosts the stock back to all-time highs any time soon. But at current levels, the rebound thesis has merit due to a rate hike slowdown, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war and the stock’s super-cheap valuation. As such, so long as the Fed maintains a dovish tone and the trade war doesn’t get worse, Ford stock should outperform.Source: ShutterstockPercent Off All-Time High: 40%Why It Has Been Killed: Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was once viewed by the market as the face of AI, and was therefore treated as a market darling. But that has changed dramatically over the past two months as the company’s growth has slowed due to the crypto bubble popping and trade headwinds threatening input costs and demand. Those issues came to a head last quarter, and the net result has been a 40% wipe-out in shareholder value in just two months.Why It Will Bounce Back: This stock will rebound because this company is still the “AI company” with broad exposure to all things AI, including cloud, machine learning, autonomous driving, and so on and so forth. All the market needs to re-value this company based on its AI potential is the right catalyst — and easing trade war tensions could be that catalyst. Trade war tensions have created cost and demand issues for Nvidia and other chipmakers. With those issues gone, that is one less thing for the market to be worried about, and one more reason for investors to buy back into NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockPercent Off All-Time High: 15%Why It Has Been Killed: Consumer robotics leader iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) is a big-growth company with a ton of trade exposure. As such, despite this company continuing to report robust growth numbers, the stock has struggled for gains recently because the prospect of bigger tariffs has threatened profitability. Specifically, last quarter, iRobot’s fourth-quarter earnings guide missed Street estimates by a mile because of tariffs pushing margins lower. Ever since that report, IRBT stock has been weak.Why It Will Bounce Back: The weak guide at the hands of tariffs is really the only thing not to like about this stock. This is a consistent 20%-plus revenue growth company with a leadership position in the nascent consumer electronics market that is oozing with global growth potential.Plus, outside of tariffs, margins have been consistently strong and improving, and that has powered steady 20%-plus profit growth. Thus, once you remove the tariff headwind, there’s a lot to like about this stock, and as such, this stock looks primed to rebound as trade war tensions ease.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA, AAPL, WMT, TGT, CAT, AMZN, TSLA, and NVDA.Compare BrokersThe post 10 Stocks to Buy With The Trade War on Pause appeared first on InvestorPlace."

President Donald Trump reached an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to halt any further tariff increases for the next 90 days. While the decision marks a pause in the trade war and not a definitive end, investors aren’t quibbling over the details. They’re buying stocks — especially Chinese stocks, with both fists.The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened over 300 points higher this morning. Investors are hoping that an end to all the tariff drama will spur global economic growth and provide further fuel for the aging expansion in the U.S.Chinese stocks, in particular, are surging in early trading making them one of the most exciting areas to shop. Here are three tickers to consider for the week ahead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsClick to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwimRather than playing the often tricky game of picking winners from losers, you could buy China outright via an exchange-traded fund. The iShares China ETF (NYSEARCA:FXI) is the most liquid one available and holds a diversified basket of publicly traded companies with direct exposure to the Chinese economy.Weighed down by trade war woes, FXI’s 2018 performance was turning out rather ugly. At the lows, FXI was down 30% from its January peak. Nonetheless, with last month’s recovery and this morning’s gap higher, the losses have been pared considerably.In the short run, some profit-taking may be in order so don’t be surprised if FXI gives back some of the gains in the coming week. But, if you believe dips are now buyable then use the weakness to sell puts such as the Jan $40 strike which is currently offering 55 cents of premium.Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwimToday’s 3% jump is placing an exclamation point on Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and its recent turnaround. Since bottoming at $130 late-October, BABA has risen 28%. More important than the percentage gain, however, has been the improvement in its price trend. Many resistance levels have given way during its ascent included the 50-day moving average and the descending trendline that defined its 5-month downtrend.Volume patterns are bolstering bulls with a few accumulation days over the past month. Like FXI, BABA is overbought in the short run and running into potential resistance. Don’t be surprised if we see some backing and filling over the coming days. But with the trend now pointing higher, dips are likely buying opportunity.Consider selling the Jan $150/$145 bull put spread for $1 or more.Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwimIf you’re looking for a higher-octane play to game the Chinese stock recovery, then consider Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). Its performance this year has been abysmal with it falling just shy of 50% from its $61 peak. But over the past six weeks, TCEHY has scored a turnaround lifting above the 50-day moving average and reversing its short-term trend higher.The stock is quite overbought so I highly recommend waiting for a retracement toward $38 before piling in. It has no listed options so you’ll have to make a straight stock purchase.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn’t hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

BABA,12-03-2018 10:08AM,Some Pre-Earnings Homework for Momo Stock Followers,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pre-earnings-homework-momo-stock-183433992.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Growth isn’t the issue for China’s Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO); it has been able to do that in spades. Rather, the yardstick by which Momo stock has been and still is judged is the pace of its growth. Anything less than red-hot forward progress has been viewed as a letdown, despite topping earnings estimates in each of its past eleven quarters.It would also be naive to pretend it hasn’t been lumped in with the likes of Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and other Chinese tech stocks. The escalating trade war and subsequent economic slowdown for the world’s second-biggest economy had spooked investors.With the tariff showdown currently taking a cease-fire and likely to be closer to its end than not though, in addition to a garden-variety oversold condition, Thursday’s earnings report may well light a fire under Momo stock again. The chart’s certainly set up for such a move.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe key will be what kind of mood investors are in at the time… will they be optimistic, or pessimistic?Originally scheduled for Wednesday morning, China’s online dating platform Momo rescheduled the report on Monday in light of the fact that U.S. markets will be closed on Dec. 5 to honor the passing of former President George HW Bush. The report and corresponding conference call are now both slated for Thursday morning, before the market opens.The delay won’t change the numbers, however, which on a relative basis should be impressive enough.As of the latest look, analysts are calling for third-quarter earnings of 54 cents per share on sales of $533.6 million. Both will be up from the year-ago comparables of 45 cents per share of MOMO stock, and a top line of $354.5 million, extending a long streak of sizable organic and non-organic growth.The numbers, of course, are only part of the story.Though Momo has introduced its own tweaks to make its take on love connections more captivating, it has also bought some of its growth. Early this year it acquired Tantan, the so-called Tinder of China, making it more like its diversified western counterpart Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), which operates Match.com, Tinder, Our Time and other online dating sites. Integration with Tantan continues.Also, like any other social networking company, current and would-be owners of MOMO stock will be looking at the number of regular users the company’s sites boasts and how long they’re logged in. During the second quarter of this year, its platforms counted 108 million regular monthly users, and total paying users of its live video service reached 11.6 million a quarter earlier. Both figures will need to grow respectably for the third quarter to be considered a success. The amount of time spent per user using the app during the second quarter was up 11% year-over-year, and that number would also ideally increase.The one soft spot that could become a pitfall? Mobile games. Revenue fell 40% during the second quarter … the only arm to see a sales decline.And, the weighing all of those factors will be further impacted by politics.The tariff war had undoubtedly crimped China’s economy at a time when it couldn’t afford to be crimped. A combination of wage headwinds and slowing job growth — or at least fear of them — has proven problematic. The agreement between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping to call a truce to the tariff war can only help put Momo’s third quarter in a positive light, though the agreement between the two leaders is far from binding.While the character and quality of Momo’s earnings are key to the stock’s response to the news, just as telling right now is the technical read in Momo stock. It’s perfectly positioned to bounce, though if it doesn’t, it’s also perfectly positioned to suffer another wave of selling.Click to Enlarge Take a look. Momo has been brutalized since June’s peak, but the selling came to a halt when a familiar support line was met. This may be a subtle sign that there are more than a few bulls waiting in the wings to step back in. They just need the right catalyst.On the other hand, if the read on the numbers is a bearish one and Momo stock breaks below the floor extending back to the late-2016 low, there’s little that can be done to sidestep another round of selling.How things pan out for the stock will largely be a matter of perspective.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

BABA,12-03-2018 02:08PM,Should You Buy Kroger (KR) Stock Before Q3 Earnings?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-kroger-kr-stock-q3-222510226.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The third quarter has been strong for retailers from Walmart WMT to Macy’s M. With that said, grocery power Kroger KR is one of the last massive retailers to report its Q3 earnings results later this week. So, let’s see what to expect from Kroger to understand if KR stock might be worth buying.OverviewAt this point, roughly 90% of the S&P 500’s retail sector has reported their quarterly earnings results, with total earnings for these retailers up 27.1% from the year-ago quarter on 6.8% higher revenues. But what does this mean for Kroger as it fights against Target TGT, Walmart, Costco COST, and others in the age of Amazon AMZN?Kroger currently offers online ordering and curbside pickup through its ClickList service. The Cincinnati-based company has also expanded its partnership with grocery delivery startup Instacart, which works with the likes of CVS CVS, as part of its Restock push. The company is also ready to roll out meal kit offerings after it purchased private meal kit firm Home Chef in an effort to compete against the likes of Blue Apron APRN.Plus, Kroger is currently working with Nuro to pilot autonomous grocery delivery.  On top of that, Kroger partnered Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba BABA to sell some of its brands in China. And the grocery firm announced a few weeks ago that it identified the location of its new “automated warehouse facility with digital and robotic capabilities.” Kroger said it will spend $55 million to build its first high-tech customer fulfillment center along with Ocado, and plans to build a total of 20.Price MovementCleary, Kroger seems ready to adapt and thrive in a quickly changing retail landscape. Yet, we should note that despite KR’s solid 10% climb over the last 52 weeks, Kroger stock sits below its 52-week high and far behind its all-time high. Kroger stock closed regular trading Monday at $29.75 per share. This marked a roughly 9% downturn from its 12-month high, and sets up what could prove to be a solid buying opportunity for investors high on Kroger stock.Outlook & Earnings TrendsKroger, which currently boasts 2,800 stores, saw its Q2 revenues pop roughly 1% to $27.87 billion. Looking ahead, the company’s third-quarter revenues are projected to dip by 0.61% to reach $27.58 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Plus, the company’s full-year revenues are expected to sink by nearly 1%.At the bottom end of the income statement, KR is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings slip by 2.3% to $0.43 per share. Investors can also see that the company’s earnings estimate revisions have trended more heavily in the wrong direction recently.Bottom LineKroger is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Momentum in our Style Scores system. The company has also started to roll out its plans for the future. Yet, it seems like KR stock might be one to stay away from ahead of earnings based on its top and bottom-line outlook and its recent earnings revision trends.Kroger is set to release its Q3 financial results before the opening bell on Thursday.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

BABA,12-03-2018 09:08AM,SBUX Stock Has Run Too Far Too Fast and Needs to Cool down a Bit,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sbux-stock-run-too-far-164822553.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.It’s been quite a reversal for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock. In June, SBUX stock seemed to be in trouble, hitting a three-year low after a disappointing update ahead of fiscal Q3 earnings.The company announced plans to close 150 stores in the U.S., seemingly signaling full saturation of the domestic market. Global same-store sales were guided to 1% for the quarter, as the company’s big bet in Asia hardly seemed to be paying off. I wrote at the time that the dip didn’t look like a buying opportunity, given decelerating growth and a still-healthy valuation.That analysis, to be blunt, turned out to be dead wrong. Starbucks stock has bounced 41% off its lows, and touched an all-time high earlier this month. A big Q4 beat helped SBUX climb but only has been part of the story. Clearly, sentiment toward SBUX stock has reversed and done so quickly.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite being wrong on the stock this summer, I’m still skeptical. FY19 guidance doesn’t signal a notable change in growth expectations. Same-store sales growth isn’t great. The company still has work to do in China.With SBUX stock trading at 25x the high end of fiscal 2019 guidance, the market is pricing Starbucks stock like a growth play again. Yet the news doesn’t seem to have changed all that much and certainly not enough to justify such a massive swing in valuation.For all the gains in Starbucks stock, Q4 earnings really weren’t that impressive. Global same-store sales growth of 3% was better than consensus expectations for 2.3% and an improvement from the 1% rise seen in Q3. But transactions actually were down in three of four regions, with performance flat in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa).Meanwhile, fiscal 2019 guidance of $2.61-$2.66 isn’t particularly notable. The average Street estimate heading into the quarter was $2.63. The figure suggests, at the midpoint, 9% growth. And operating margins, per the 10-K, are expected to compress next year.Starbucks stock had been range-bound for years until the recent breakout. And the concerns were myriad. The U.S. market was saturated. Wage increases had the potential to pressure margins. Competition was keeping same-store sales growth down.None of those concerns seem particularly assuaged. Operating margins are coming down. U.S. growth is slowing to a 3% net unit increase next year. Trade war concerns can hit the business in China, even bu just raising the ire of Chinese citizens toward an American company. And same-store sales still have decelerated notably, falling from 6% in FY14 and 7% in FY15 to 3% in FY17 and 2% in FY18.That’s a profile that suggests a high-teen or maybe low-twenties earnings multiple. Instead, SBUX stock now trades at 25x earnings. Even analysts haven’t been able to catch up: Starbucks stock has passed the average Street target price of $66+.What’s interesting about the gains in SBUX is that they’ve come at a time when the stock could easily have been pressured. U.S. stocks have taken a tumble since early October.The buyout of the joint venture in China makes that market hugely important for Starbucks. One only need to look at the stock charts of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) to see how investors feel about that economy right now.That said, restaurant stocks have shown some strength, perhaps surprisingly given macro fears. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) has broken out to an all-time high, for instance. But Dunkin’ Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) has traded sideways and Yum! China (NYSE:YUMC) is down 10%+ this year.And there is some growth potential here. 600 new stores are going into China, and 400 licensed stores in EMEA. The company said on the call that its consumer business deal with Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) would be accretive in FY20.It’s not as if earnings growth is falling off a cliff. There is good news here. I’m just not sure whether that good news is worth paying 25x earnings, particularly with China such a big part of the story.For investors willing to take that risk, there’s probably a case for SBUX. EPS likely clears $3 next year, assuming China doesn’t blow up. A 2%+ dividend yield helps the case, and the company will continue to buy back stock. With MCD and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) trading at similar multiples, valuation might not be that prohibitive, either.Still, I can’t shake the feeling that investors forgot about Starbucks’ problems awfully quickly. Nor am I certain they won’t remember them again at some point in the future.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.Compare BrokersThe post SBUX Stock Has Run Too Far Too Fast and Needs to Cool down a Bit appeared first on InvestorPlace."

BABA,12-02-2018 06:09PM,Here is Why You Should Buy Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-buy-alphabet-inc-googl-164736765.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.While the market driven by short-term sentiment influenced by uncertainty regarding the future of the interest rate environment in the US, declining oil prices and the trade war with China, many smart money investors are keeping their optimism regarding the current bull run, while still hedging many of their long positions. However, as we know, big investors usually buy stocks with strong fundamentals, which is why we believe we can profit from imitating them. In this article, we are going to take a look at the smart money sentiment surrounding Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Is Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ready to rally soon? Prominent investors are becoming hopeful. The number of bullish hedge fund bets moved up by 12 in recent months. GOOGL was in 137 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of September. There were 125 hedge funds in our database with GOOGL holdings at the end of the previous quarter. GOOGL was the fourth most popular stock among hedge funds at the end of September (see the list of 30 most popular stocks among ALL hedge funds). Today there are plenty of tools shareholders put to use to appraise their stock investments. Two of the less utilized tools are hedge fund and insider trading interest. Our experts have shown that, historically, those who follow the best picks of the best hedge fund managers can outperform the broader indices by a healthy margin (see the details here).  Let's take a peek at the fresh hedge fund action regarding Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).At Q3's end, a total of 137 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of 10% from one quarter earlier. Below, you can check out the change in hedge fund sentiment towards GOOGL over the last 13 quarters. So, let's find out which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.  More specifically, Citadel Investment Group was the largest shareholder of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), with a stake worth $1752.4 million reported as of the end of September. Trailing Citadel Investment Group was Fisher Asset Management, which amassed a stake valued at $1534.3 million. AQR Capital Management, Lansdowne Partners, and Diamond Hill Capital were also very fond of the stock, giving the stock large weights in their portfolios. Now, key hedge funds were leading the bulls' herd. Renaissance Technologies, managed by Jim Simons, created the biggest position in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Renaissance Technologies had $223.2 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Alexander Mitchell's Scopus Asset Management also initiated a $112.9 million position during the quarter. The other funds with brand new GOOGL positions are Frank Brosens's Taconic Capital, David Costen Haley's HBK Investments, and Ian Simm's Impax Asset Management. Let's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) but similarly valued. We will take a look at Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA). This group of stocks' market values match GOOGL's market value. [table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position GOOG,130,13711323,8 BRK-B,84,24061146,3 FB,164,16604320,-29 BABA,127,15116904,10 [/table] As you can see these stocks had an average of 126.25 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $17373 million. That figure was $14319 million in GOOGL's case. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is the least popular one with only 84 bullish hedge fund positions. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. When it comes to Google, we agree with billionaire Druckenmiller's assessment. The stock is way too cheap for a company that's investing huge sums into future technologies (i.e. its earnings are understated), yet trade at a forward PE multiple of 20. The recent price decline in GOOGL shares provided a very attractive entry point if you aren't already invested in this stock. We believe investors will beat the market by staying away from low growth stocks that trade at similar forward earnings multiples and buying GOOGL. Disclosure: None.

BABA,11-30-2018 06:09PM,Better Long-Term Buy: Amazon (AMZN) vs. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-long-term-buy-amazon-213509588.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Shares of both Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT have been hurt by the recent market downturn that has seen the likes of Apple AAPL, Netflix NFLX, and other tech giants fall. With that said, both AMZN and MSFT are still up big over the last year and the companies are headed in the right direction.AMZN OverviewAmazon’s Q3 revenues climbed by 29% to reach $56.6 billion, which fell short of Wall Street estimates and helped show that its days of massive top-line growth might be over simply because of its size. Still, the tech powerhouse is projected to grab roughly 50% of the total U.S. e-commerce market in 2018, up from 44% last year. Plus, Amazon’s advertising business is set to expand as more and more product searches begin on its site.Jeff Bezos’ firm is now the third-largest digital advertiser behind only Facebook FB and Google GOOGL. On top of that, Amazon has expanded into the pharmaceutical industry and its Prime Video platform looks poised to stand out against Netflix and soon enough Apple AAPL and Disney DIS as it pushes deeper into live sports. And let’s not forget that Amazon is still a cloud-computing powerhouse.MSFT OverviewSpeaking of cloud computing, Microsoft is the second-largest cloud provider—behind only Amazon—having grabbed roughly 14% of the cloud market in the third quarter. This put MSFT in front of IBM IBM, Google, and Alibaba BABA. On top of that, the historic tech firm has continued to dive deeper into artificial intelligence and IoT.Meanwhile, the company has bolstered its business through some significant acquisitions, which includes its June purchase of open source software powerhouse GitHub. Microsoft also landed some major contracts for its cloud and AI business this year, including Walmart WMT. And let’s not forget that its personal computing business is massive and helped its most recent quarterly revenues jump 19% to $29.1 billion.Stock Price MovementAs we mentioned at the top, both AMZN and MSFT have seen their stock prices fall recently. Amazon stock is down 16% over the last three months, while Microsoft dipped just around 2%. Yet, Amazon stock has blown away MSFT over the last decade, but that doesn’t really tell us much since the e-commerce firm has been on one of the most impressive runs in Wall Street history.Investors should note that MSFT stock hovered at around $110 per share through late afternoon trading Friday, which marked a roughly 5% downturn from its 52-week and all-time high. Meanwhile, Amazon stock sat approximately 18% below its recent highs at around $1,686 a share.OutlookLooking ahead, Amazon is expected to see its Q4 revenues climb roughly 18.5% to reach $71.61 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s total fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to jump 30.8% to $232.69 billion. Plus, Amazon’s full-year 2019 revenues are expected to climb over 20% above our current 2018 estimate.At the bottom end of the income statement, Amazon’s adjusted fourth quarter revenues are projected to skyrocket 153.7% to $5.48 per share. Meanwhile, AMZN’s fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to soar 328%.Microsoft’s outlook is a bit less impressive, which is to be expected based on its age. MSFT’s current quarter revenues are expected to jump 12.2% to $32.46 billion. The company’s full-year revenues are projected to climb at a similar rate to reach $124.08 billion—with the following year expected to jump 10% above that.Furthermore, Microsoft’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb by 13.5% to hit $1.09 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by over 14%.Bottom LineBoth Amazon and Microsoft have strong management teams and have expanded their offerings to better position themselves for the future. We should note that MSFT has earned more positive earnings estimate revisions recently. Plus, Microsoft has been a dividend payer for years and its valuation picture—trading at 23.7X forward earnings estimates compared to Amazon’s 64.3X—looks much better than its peer.On the other hand, Amazon will likely pay a dividend once its outsized growth starts to slow. But Bezos and Amazon are poised to continue to expand into as many new industries as possible. Therefore, it seems like it is a toss-up between Amazon and Microsoft at the moment since both stocks offer investors different benefits.3 Medical Stocks to Buy NowThe greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

The call screening transcripts feature, first noted back in November, are starting to arrive for Pixel users, Google confirmed with TechCrunch.Making good on the “end of year” promise, the offering has been rolling out for a few days now, bringing with it the ability to read voice transcriptions of voice mails. An addition to the Pixel’s existing call screening feature, the feature answers calls from unknown numbers via Google Assistant and utilizes the company’s solid voice-to-text to offer a transcription of the call.In spite of the wide rollout, there are still some limitations here. For starters, this particular feature is only available for the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. And it’s only rolling out to users in the States at the moment, though Google’s promised to bring it to additional countries in additional languages “in the future.”"
GOOG,12-03-2018 09:09AM,Microsoft announces live captioning and subtitles for deaf,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-announces-live-captioning-subtitles-hearing-impaired-173046869.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Microsoft (MSFT) on Monday announced that it’s bringing live captioning and subtitles to two of its biggest products, PowerPoint and Skype. Set to coincide with the United Nations’ International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the move will facilitate communications between users with hearing difficulties or who speak different languages.I was able to experience the new communication features during a recent visit to Microsoft’s massive Redmond, Washington, campus. It worked incredibly well, offering seamless, real-time captioning that kept up with every word spoken in the room.That became a problem when it was translating Spanish to English and I began speaking in English, but that’s to be expected.Of course, Microsoft isn’t the only company working on or offering accessibility features for its consumers.Apple’s (AAPL) iOS lets individual users configure playback and captioning, and can read content out loud for those who have vision issues. There’s also a guided control feature that lets parents or caregivers ensure individuals with autism or attention and sensory issues stay on task by disabling the Home button, as well as portions of the display to limit accidental inputs.Microsoft’s accessibility team is run by Jenny Lay-Flurrie, the company’s chief accessibility officer and someone who understands how important such features are for users. As someone who’s been nearly deaf her whole life, Lay-Flurrie also stands to benefit from the captioning features coming to PowerPoint and Skype.According to the World Health Organization, roughly 1 billion people in the world have some form of disability. And unfortunately, using a computer or smartphone isn’t exactly easy for many of them.By adding real-time captioning, Microsoft will be able to open up PowerPoint and Skype to individuals with hearing problems. So if you’re hard of hearing, you’ll still be able to keep up with your coworker’s presentation, or chat with your friends and family across the globe. Of course, sign language is always an option, but thousands of people with hearing problems can’t sign. And if you also have a physical disability, signing might not even be an option.Outside of individuals with hearing problems, the captioning feature will also benefit folks without hearing problems who are working with others who speak different languages thanks to real-time translations.During my demonstration, the real-time translation provided English captions when a Microsoft representative was speaking Spanish and vice versa.But there are millions of other device users in the world who have disabilities unrelated to their hearing abilities.

GOOG,12-03-2018 04:09AM,Google Maps update ensures Assistant stays out of the way,https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/03/google-maps-update-assistant-less-intrusive/?yptr=yahoo,"Google recently launched a slew of updates for Assistant, and now it's making its AI helper smarter and more discrete for Maps. Reddit user raddacle noticed that Assistant on maps now takes up very little space when it pops up, and keeps navigation open when you place calls and do other chores. The last version of Maps would instead open the dialer, reducing navigation to quarter-screen mode -- something that can be distracting while you're driving.The only clue that the Assistant is even operating is a compact bottom bar that covers your ETA and distance ETA, while still letting you see turn-by-turn directions. You can activate it the usual way, by saying ""OK Google"" or tapping the microphone, which is now multi-colored instead of gray.Google said it would unveil a less intrusive version of Assistant for Google Maps back in May 2018 at I/O. On top of making calls, you can also launch YouTube videos (to hear the sound, not watch the video), send texts and do other chores. Many of these features were already available on Android Auto, but of course, many of us with older cars just use our smartphones when navigating. It's only just started rolling out, apparently, so the feature might not arrive to your phone for awhile.'Overture' includes a new map, new modes and an 'emotional' mission.It's an unfortunate streak.StorySign turns words on the page into sign language.Google phone owners should have fewer memory management problems.Just 1,500 people still use the devices."
GOOG,12-03-2018 12:09PM,"Could Alphabet Stock Be Crippled by Major Risks, Tough Challenge?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-alphabet-stock-crippled-major-201106735.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.In Reid Hoffman’s excellent book, Blitzscaling: The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies, he looks at what it takes to supercharge a company’s growth and dominate an industry. Of course, dominating industries leads to massive stock gains.One of the companies that Hoffman covers is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). He notes: “At Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin built great search algorithms, but it was their innovations to the search engine business model – specifically, considering relevance and performance when displaying advertisements rather than simply renting space to the highest bidder – that drove their massive success.”Hoffman’s assessment is spot-on. As of now, GOOGL stock is worth a staggering $757 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet maintaining success is never easy. The tech market is full of examples of epic implosions. Take a look at what happened to Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB). Not long ago, they seemed to be unbeatable leaders in the lucrative mobile phone market.So what might go wrong for GOOGL stock? Where are its vulnerabilities? Well, interestingly enough, the main threats to GOOGL may not necessarily be from scrappy startups. Instead, the real problem for GOOGL stock could ultimately come from other huge tech companies, such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).Keep in mind that AMZN has taken a low-profile approach to its move into the online ad business. But nowadays, AMZN’s efforts in that area are getting too hard to hide. The fact is that Amazon’s online ad business is becoming a major source of its growth.According to research from eMarketer, Amazon’s ad revenues are projected to double this year to $5.83 billion. And based on analysis from Cowen & Co, the e-commerce giant’s ad business could ultimately be worth as much as $28.4 billion. If that forecast – which does seem reasonable – proves accurate, then GOOGL stock could easily come under a great deal of pressure.AMZN has a unique advantage: its massive e-commerce platform. When people visit the site or its other apps and platforms, they are generally focused on making purchases. That is certainly an attractive attribute for any advertiser. By comparison, when a user does a Google search, he or she may have other reasons to do so i.e. to learn something or to be entertained.AMZN also has tremendous amounts of purchase data on its customers. This will likely be a major competitive advantage for AMZN, as the data should enable advertisers to enjoy much higher conversion rates.AMZN is not the only factor that could weigh on GOOGL stock. The company is also facing some other major challenges. For example, its privacy policies and alleged anticompetitive practices are being scrutinized. The European Union has already levied a $5 billion fine against the company because of its actions involving its Android operating system.But this may be just the beginning. GOOGL is also involved in litigation in the EU regarding the company’s potential violations of the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) act.Interestingly enough, monetary damages may not be the real problem for Alphabet and GOOGL stock. Rather, the major harm to Alphabet stock is likely to come from restrictions on the company’s use of data, which could ultimately make it much more difficult for GOOGL to monetize its platforms in Europe.Over the years, GOOGL has been trying to become involved in businesses other than digital ads. Yet its results have been mixed. Just look at the company’s cloud segment. Despite making substantial investments in its cloud business, GOOGL has not been able to gain much traction in the cloud space, as it has just 3.3% of the market. Conversely, AMZN has a 51.8% share and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) share is 13.3%. Note that GOOGL recently hired a new executive to head its cloud unit.Now for the most part, the major risks facing GOOGL stock will not have a material impact on the stock for some time. And GOOGL still has some major advantages, including a huge cash position as well as multiple, highly successful assets like YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, Android and Play. But if GOOGL wants to continue to thrive, the company should start acting more aggressively, and it should do so as soon as possible.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling. Follow him on Twitter at @ttaulli. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare BrokersThe post Could Alphabet Stock Be Crippled by Major Risks, Tough Challenge? appeared first on InvestorPlace."

GOOG,12-03-2018 07:09AM,Amazon Echo Smart Speakers Will Stream Apple Music,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-echo-smart-speakers-stream-153822694.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are smart speaker competitors and digital assistant competitors. But they share a common foe in both of these critical markets: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), more specifically Google. In yet another sign of cooperation between the two tech giants, another barrier has been broken. Starting December 17, Apple Music will launch on Amazon Echo smart speakers.In a blog post on Friday, Amazon announced that starting the week of December 17, Echo smart speaker owners will be able to stream Apple Music on their devices. They’ll also be able to use Alexa to control Apple Music.“We’re thrilled to bring Apple Music — one of the most popular music services in the U.S. — to Echo customers this holiday.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is good news for Echo owners, but even better news for Amazon. Apple Music has a lot of subscribers (56 million at last count). If they want integrated smart speaker operation, but lack the cash to plunk down $349 for an Apple HomePod, there’s an entire range of Echo smart speakers to choose from. Google Home — which is rapidly catching up to the Echo in popularity — does not offer this capability.In addition, more people pinging Amazon Echo smart speakers with questions related to Apple Music helps AMZN’s Alexa.Google Assistant is considered to be the “smartest” of the personal digital assistants. The more these AI-powered features are used, the smarter they get thanks to machine learning. Google has a big lead there thanks in no small part to its dominance of the smartphone market with Android. Amazon lacks a presence in this platform, so the more people who use Alexa on an Echo smart speaker the better. If they’re asking questions or barking commands outside of Amazon’s own core services, all the better.On the surface, this move seems like a bigger win for Amazon. Amazon Echo smart speakers get more attractive — and with onboard Apple Music support, there’s one less reason to buy an Apple HomePod smart speaker.Apple probably figures that anyone who was considering a HomePod is not going to change their mind and pick an Echo instead just because they now get Apple Music support. Most people buy a HomePod because they love Apple hardware and/or they want a superior audio experience, and nothing changes in that equation.However, suddenly having onboard Apple Music support available on millions of Amazon Echo smart speakers eliminates an advantage that streaming music rival Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) had over Apple Music. That’s one more reason to subscribe to Apple Music, and with Friday’s announcement you can bet a chunk of Amazon Echo owners are going to sign up for free 3-month trials.With Apple Music and other subscription-based Services revenue increasingly important to AAPL’s bottom line — and to Apple stock — Amazon’s support is a big deal.Adding Apple Music support to the Amazon Echo continues a trend toward the two tech giants moving closer together. Prime video on the Apple TV, followed by Amazon selling the Apple video streamer was a start. Just a few weeks ago, Amazon went all-in on offering Apple products for sale on its website, including selling iPhones, the Apple Watch, and iPads.With Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the rear view mirror for 2018, the push is on for Amazon to move as many Echo smart speakers as possible. Google is doing the same with its Google Home lineup, but this year Amazon will have one new feature the Google Home lacks: Apple Music support.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare BrokersThe post Amazon Echo Smart Speakers Will Stream Apple Music appeared first on InvestorPlace."
GOOG,12-03-2018 07:09AM,Is It Too Late to Buy Alphabet Stock Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-buy-alphabet-stock-now-153341495.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.If you were thinking about buying Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) during the latest downturn, I hope you pulled the trigger when it was near $1,000. Ending last week up over $1,100 and running even higher now, many investors are wondering if they’ve missed their chance to buy GOOGL stock. That depends.For long-term investors, the name of the game is having a lower cost basis. For short-term traders, it’s about having momentum working in your favor, whether long or short. We almost never buy the bottom and sell the top, but getting as close as we can always helps.After last week’s breakout, GOOGL stock certainly has momentum at its back. Shares are up almost $100 apiece over the last week and it’s off to the races. The question now is, will we get a buyable pullback in Alphabet?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFrom a technical perspective, we told investors to buy GOOGL stock on a pullback to $1,010. Alphabet fell a few bucks below that mark, giving their opportunity for entry. However, the problem is that when great entry opportunities like this come by, investors are usually too panicked to step in.That makes plenty of sense because their hard-earned money is on the line. Who wants to lose that? No one, and the hesitation is totally reasonable. But with certain companies — like Alphabet — we need to realize a few things.The first is the business. Even though we’re talking about GOOGL stock, don’t think of it as just a stock. Think of Alphabet as a company. We’re talking about an enterprise that has two of the internet’s most popular websites in the world, Google.com and YouTube.com.The internet is the highway to advertising. While Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are big players in the internet ad space, Alphabet is considered king and there’s little reason to bet against it. YouTube has numbers you would hardly believe. YouTube users stream more than 1 billion hours per day.With those two assets, I find little reason to bet against Alphabet. More so though, GOOGL stock is a leader in the driverless car revolution. Some analysts are assigning valuations of more than $150 billion for this unit. Finally, its cloud business is no joke either, helping to drive sales growth higher.The other reason? Its valuation and balance sheet. GOOGL stock trades at 25 times this year’s earnings, which is reasonable given its ~20% annual revenue run rate and double-digit percentage growth in earnings. Finally, with $106 billion in cash and ~$4 billion in debt, one could consider Alphabet a titan with respect to its balance sheet.That’s why we step in and buy GOOGL stock on deep pullbacks.Okay, okay. We get it, Google’s fundamentals are top notch. So what does the chart say for GOOGL stock?When companies with strong fundamentals go on sale, we buy them. This is particularly true as they fall into support, giving long-term investors a nice cost basis and short-term traders a solid risk/reward. For GOOGL stock, that came into play around $1,000 a share.That support level held and Alphabet stock jumped back into its falling channel (blue lines). It didn’t take long for shares to power through resistance and run from $1,060 to $1109 in just a few days. Technically, shares were able to close above the 50-day and on Monday, they are trying to close above the 200-day.If we get a strong push into year end — which statistically, is quite possible — then resistance might not play a huge role just yet. However, it’s worth keeping an eye on this $1,140 area.It’s just above the 200-day moving average and is a downtrend resistance mark dating back to July, when GOOGL stock hit its all-time highs near $1,300. Just above this area, near $1,160, is the 100-day moving average. If Alphabet can clear this area, it’s all-time highs are on the table. If not though, it will need time to set back up as a long candidate.Investors can buy on a pullback-and-hold of the 50-day, while more aggressive investors can buy if GOOGL can clear-and-hold $1,130.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

GOOG,12-03-2018 07:09AM,3 Charts Show Why Dropbox Stock Will (Eventually) Be a Buy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-charts-show-why-dropbox-153154093.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Even when the internet was no longer new, the idea of multi-user access to the same online document seemed foreign… maybe even a little unnecessary. After all, documents could be readily exchanged back and forth via e-mail. What would be the point?A little over 10 years ago, Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) began to unwind that erroneous assumption.Now? Mission accomplished.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd yet, not only is Dropbox still a mostly unknown entity, DBX stock still ranks as one of the market’s most overlooked and underestimated opportunities. Three charts should at least start to correct that problem, likely leading investors to wonder why in the world Dropbox stock has been steadily selling off from June’s peak after going public in March.Truth be told, organizations of all sizes could accomplish much of the same functionality as Dropbox using the free Google Drive, from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or paying to use the Office-Online platform from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Somehow, though, a dedicated file-sharing platform like Box (NYSE:BOX) or Dropbox seems far better equipped to handle the task. And of the singularly focused platforms, Dropbox is arguably the best when it comes to letting many users view and update the same document. There’s a reason customers are willing to pay for the service.To that end, the company is still adding paying customers, and at its current rate of growth will soon reach a critical mass in terms of profitability. That’s the part of most interest to investors… not what’s already occurred, but what’s about to happen.The chart below tells part of the curiously compelling tale. Analysts are only calling for revenue growth through 2020 that extends the trend already underway. Better still, per-share earnings are expected to nearly double between the current quarter and the final quarter of 2020.Click to EnlargeIt’s hard to doubt the lofty growth targets in light of the fact that Dropbox’s sales are largely recurring revenue. Once a customer is brought into the fold, they tend to stick around. Assuming the company’s fixed costs remain fixed, any scale-up in the top line is magnified on the bottom line.But does the anticipated sequential drop in per-share profits for the quarter currently underway suggest this year’s swell of earnings was only a temporary stroke of luck? Not really.Dropbox is a relatively new stock; since IPOing in March, DBX shares have lost almost 18% versus the Nasdaq Composite’s 6.2% gain. The dozen or so analysts who now follow it have only been tracking and forecasting estimates for three quarters now. And so far, they’ve underestimated how profitable the organization is.A chart from Estimize, clearly makes the point. Dropbox has handily topped earnings estimates in its past three quarters, in one case more than doubling the bottom line Wall Street pros were modeling. It’s likely the Q4 estimate of eight cents per share once again understates how profitable Dropbox will be… by a lot.Click to EnlargeAssuming the company continues to beat estimates, DBX stock is actually priced at only about 30 times 2019’s likely earnings rather than the forward-looking P/E of 55 based on analyst outlooks that are simply too low.Finally, and perhaps most important, while the equities research community is apt to still be underestimating Dropbox’s profitability, they’ve not been unwilling to maintain lofty target prices on DBX stock even though it’s been trending lower since June. Indeed, the consensus call on the shares has actually become even more bullish in the meantime.Click to EnlargeThis degree of conviction against the tide (and in the face of criticism) speaks volumes.Does all of this add up to a guarantee that Dropbox has already bottomed and will finally begin to trend higher from here? No, far from it. There are no guarantees in this business, and arguably, investors — and analysts for their part on earnings estimates — should have had their “aha” moment weeks ago. If the crowd has decided it’s going to push DBX stock lower, then there’s little to be gained by fighting the tape.On the other hand, in the end, fundamentals always win. The game here isn’t figuring out if Dropbox will finally turn. It’s only a matter of when. The company’s clearly doing its part, and it’s not like analysts don’t see it, even if they’re still underestimating it.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

All too often, female competence is not as well-received as male confidence in our corporate culture today. Author and comedian Sarah Cooper channeled those frustrations into her new book, “How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men’s Feelings,” a humorous how-to guide for women looking to get ahead.Cooper learned the lessons that fill her illustration-heavy book — and her successful blog, The Cooper Review — while working in the tech trenches as a designer for Google. “This book is all of the things that I did that I absolutely hated that I did,” she tells Yahoo Finance. “The way that I would change my tone or be less direct or put a bunch of smiley faces and emojis in my emails — all of those things, I did them all. I still do a lot of them.”Some memories from the office like particularly stand out. “When I first started at Google, I had a strong opinion about the color of one of the default shapes in Google Slides,” Cooper says. “I just went up to the engineer and I just said, ‘This is ugly, can we just change this?’ And he wouldn’t look directly at me. And then in my performance review later that year, I was told I needed to be more sensitive about people’s feelings about colors.”The experience of writing the advice in the book was therapeutic for Cooper. “A lot of these topics are so depressing, and it’s like, how do you laugh when it’s so sad that women have to deal with this stuff?” she says.“The way that I found into the humor was just to create a book that just is overwhelmingly rule after rule after rule after rule, to the point where you realize, ‘Oh this is ridiculous. This is insane, this is impossible. It’s impossible to follow any of these rules.’ So that’s what I tried to do, just reflect back this lose-lose situation that women are in.’”Crafted as career advice for women, Cooper’s work grapples with the concept of male fragility.“I don’t like to generalize. I love men. My husband’s a man, and he’s great. I married him, so he must be great,” she says. “I just want them to see another perspective, you know? I’m not trying to create a war of the sexes or anything like that. I really just want them to appreciate that as a woman working in a male-dominated industry, this is a unique experience.”Cooper’s book is full of tongue-in-cheek advice gleaned from frustratingly real work situations. But since even the best jokes can sometimes be taken too seriously, Cooper gave us her real thoughts on some of the workplace scenarios presented.Asking for a promotion “I put in the book the threatening way is to say ‘I’d like a promotion,’ and the non-threatening way is to get a man to ask your manager for you if you could be promoted,” Cooper explains. “This happened to friends of mine, where they wanted to put themselves out there, but they were cautioned against that and they were told to have someone vouch for them first so they didn’t seem like they were too power-hungry.”As for what Cooper would really like to see? “I want more women to ask and be very direct about this, because I think the more women that do it, the less it’s an anomaly – the less it’s this weird thing.”Getting interrupted For women in the workplace, getting interrupted is a longstanding issue. So how do you deal with it?“The threatening thing is to be like, ‘Excuse me, I was talking. Can I finish what I’m saying?’ And the non-threatening way would be to just stop talking and maybe email them later about what you were trying to say during the meeting,” Cooper explains, before offering a clever tip: “A really cool trick I saw someone do if you don’t want to get interrupted is to start by saying, ‘There are three things I want to say about this.’ Then people know to wait for that third thing, and if you don’t have a third thing, you can say, ‘Yeah I guess that’s all I wanted to say.’”Setting deadlines “In the book, I talk about how being very direct and saying, ‘Hey, this is the deadline’ is very threatening,” she says. “So you should say, ‘What do you think about getting this to me about my 5 p.m.?’”Cooper’s advice? Just go with the “threatening” version. “That’s just one of those things where you can be direct. And hopefully, the more women that are direct, then it won’t be seen as a weird thing. I do have hope that over time, with more women joining the workforce, with more women becoming leaders, it isn’t going to be this weird thing for a woman to directly tell someone what to do.”Follow Ned Ehrbar on Twitter.This story was originally published on November 19, 2018.More from our Women + Money series:"
AMZN,12-03-2018 07:09AM,Prime members ordered 2 billion products for one-day or faster delivery this year,https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/prime-members-ordered-2-billion-products-for-one-day-or-faster-delivery-this-year/?yptr=yahoo,"In Amazon’s year-end wrap-up released on Monday, the retailer offered details about its best-selling products of 2018, as well as a few new metrics related to its delivery business. The company said that Prime members worldwide this year ordered more than 2 billion products for one-day or faster delivery — the first time it’s shared numbers for faster-than-two-day delivery — and that more new members signed up for Prime in 2018 than in years prior.That latter metric has been fairly consistent — Amazon said the same in its 2017 wrap-up, as well.While the retailer had historically kept the number of Prime members under wraps, that changed this April when Amazon announced a milestone of passing 100 million Prime members worldwide, which it cited again today.Amazon last year had also offered some figures related to its Prime shipping business, but then focused on its two-day delivery service. In 2017, more than 5 billion items were shipping with Prime worldwide.It’s notable then, in the course of a year, that Prime’s one-day or faster shipping is now nearing half the size of Prime two-day.However, Amazon did not say how many total Prime deliveries were made this year, nor did it break-out its two-day figures. (We’ve asked, and it declined to share those numbers.) Instead, it touted the expanded reach of its faster-than-two-day delivery offerings, including Prime Now (two-hour), Prime one-day and Prime same-day.It said that one-day and same-day delivery is now available across 8,000 cities and towns, while two-hour delivery now reaches more than 30 major cities. The traditional Prime two-day shipping, meanwhile, is available across 100 million items, Amazon also said.These are the same figures Amazon reported last year, we should note.However, Amazon’s focus in 2018 was more so on its grocery delivery business via Whole Foods, which is now available in more than 60 cities across the U.S. and still expanding. The top markets for Whole Foods delivery this year were Austin, San Francisco and Boston, the retailer said.Amazon detailed its top-sellers across product categories, too, and offered a few other figures related to its efforts in video, music, reading and more.Most notably, its investment in bringing NFL live streams to Prime Video reached 20 million total viewers across more than 200 countries and all 50 U.S. states across the nine Thursday Night Football games. Last year, the 10 games it streamed reached 18 million viewers, so there’s been a slight increase here.Its most-binged Prime Original series worldwide to date were Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan starring John Krasinski and Homecoming starring Julia Roberts.It also said that its top-selling product in the U.S. was the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, followed by the Echo Dot. Both got a big bump thanks to Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday week discounts. The Dot was also the top seller during the Black Friday-Cyber Monday weekend."
AMZN,12-03-2018 06:09AM,Trump’s G20 bromance with Xi means one thing: an epic Santa Claus rally for stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-g20-bromance-xi-means-one-thing-epic-santa-claus-rally-stocks-142002188.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.It’s time to charge that extra $5,000 holiday gift because the year-end for stocks could be pretty sweet.And you can thank President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping for the inevitable rip-roaring rally into 2019.Well, that and investor foe turned short-termed bestie, Fed Chair Jerome Powell.What happened: Trump and his Chinese counterpart agreed at this weekend’s G20 to delay higher tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods from China; the increase, from 10% to 25% was set to hit Jan. 1. The decision will be a 90-day ceasefire. China will purchase a “very substantial” amount of agricultural, industrial and electronics products, according to the U.S. side.Trump followed what amounts to a weekend win for U.S. businesses with a late night tweet Sunday that China would reduce and remove tariffs on imported autos. The rate currently stands at a penalizing 40%.In July, China lowered tariffs on U.S. cars to 15% from 25%. But it then quickly reversed course and enacted a 25% additional retaliatory tariff in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese products.A White House spokesperson didn’t immediately return a request for clarification on Trump’s tweet.Markets around the globe spiked on Monday in response to the cooling of a modern day cold war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 287 points. German automakers BMW and Daimler popped 7.3% and 7.5%, respectively, as the reduction of tariffs could unleash better sales in China.Why it matters: Stocks have had a rough go since hitting record highs in early October. But concerns over an unfriendly Federal Reserve and profit-margin-killing tariffs — the key factors in the blow-off from the October highs — have reversed rather quickly. That’s positive news for the markets.For one, Powell’s speech at the Economic Club last week suggested he will not move very quickly hiking rates in 2019. Powell realizes that he could tip the U.S. economy into recession if not careful.Investors could now sleep easier on this front, for a little while at least. With the perception of the Fed being a touch more accommodative, investors are apt to wade back into beaten-up, above-normal risk assets. See battered tech stocks such as Apple, Netflix and Amazon.Meanwhile, Trump’s ceasefire on his trade war with China removes a significant black cloud hanging over the heads of investors. Companies of all kinds for months have warned on the impact of having to raise prices to offset tariffs. Walmart’s chief financial officer Brett Biggs, for instance, told Yahoo Finance in November the retailer would be forced to raise prices on shoppers if the higher tariff went into effect in January. Walmart, like many retailers, source a good percentage of their merchandise from China.Other companies have spent most of 2018 figuring out how to diversify their supply chains away from China. That has come at monetary and human capital costs, with more on the way if the trade war continues.At the same time, with the plunge in soybean prices thanks to China’s retaliatory efforts, America’s heartland has been slammed. Farm bankruptcies are on the rise as farmers are unable to find buyers for their crops.Blake Hurst, the president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, told Yahoo Finance that his fellow farmers will unlikely be buying expensive equipment in the next year. Hurst says farmers are just trying to survive the year, let alone find ways to justify spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on new equipment.But with China’s new commitment to buying U.S. agricultural products, the outlook for farmers is arguably vastly better than it was one week ago. That has implications not only for farmers, but for companies like railroads that assist in shipping their products.Wall Street has used this uncertain backdrop to lower their profit forecasts for S&P 500 companies in recent months. They may revisit those lowered estimates, and in doing so help prop up the markets.Bottom line: Wall Street is doing its darnedest to poo-poo the weekend’s events at the G20. Unsurprising as many strategists were caught on the wrong side of the trade into the unpredictable gathering.“Another reason to wait before cheering the end of the trade war is that 90 days to work out a broad agreement is very short. Especially because the agreement should also encompass a deal on more sensitive issues like the theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfers in joint ventures. Most wide-ranging bilateral trade agreements take years to negotiate,” says ING strategist Raoul Leering.Says Goldman Sachs strategist Alec Phillips: “While the Xi-Trump dinner has clearly improved the tone of the U.S.-China relationship for the time being, and we would expect an initial positive market reaction, the “pause” prolongs the period of uncertainty around the eventual structure of trade relations between the two countries.”Perhaps.Common sense says though the trio of Trump, Powell and Xi have set the groundwork for a healthy rally into year end. Uncertainty has been removed and stocks are well off their highs, a recipe for investors to go bargain hunting. Whether that leads to a stock market melt-up like we saw in January of this year is unknown. Either way, the Santa Clause rally is poised to kick into overdrive and bring with it a lot of good cheer to trading accounts.__Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.

AMZN,11-28-2018 06:09PM,How Amazon hijacked the baby registry,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-hijacked-baby-registry-113210573.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Expecting parents with Amazon baby registries are getting some unexpected gifts.Amazon sold sponsored product slots that let companies like Johnson & Johnson place ads alongside regular items in baby registries, the Wall Street Journal reported (paywall) Nov. 28. The ads were nearly identical to products picked out by the actual registrants—distinguished only by the word “Sponsored” in small gray text—and tricked friends and family members into purchasing sponsored items without realizing it.Rana LaPine, 24, of Denver, told the Journal she didn’t realize an Aveeno bath-time set she bought for a friend was an advertisement until it was pointed out by a Journal reporter. “I feel terrible about that and wish I had gotten her something else,” LaPine said. “I usually am good about seeing things marked as ads.”Can you spot the ad?Amazon has rapidly ramped up its advertising business, and now ranks behind only Google and Facebook in US digital ad revenue. Most of the company’s ad dollars come from preferential product placement on Amazon.com that the company sells to manufacturers, similar to premium spots on the ends of aisles that a marketer might buy in a supermarket. In the first nine months of 2018, Amazon booked $6.7 billion in revenue in its “other” segment, which is primarily made up of advertising.While consumers are used to ads showing up in search engines or on routine product lookups on Amazon.com, the baby registry scenario feels different because the sponsored products are being inserted into a private curated list, where consumers aren’t necessarily on the lookout for sponsored content. The ads were even dressed up with a “0 of 1 purchased” line. Target, Walmart, and Bed Bath & Beyond don’t put sponsored items in registries.The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon has been placing sponsored ads in baby registries for more than a year. The company calls them “native baby-registry product placements” and sells three per quarter, according to an internal presentation viewed by the Journal, for $500,000 plus an additional spending requirement for the advertiser of $500,000 to $3 million on other Amazon ads.A spokeswoman for Amazon told the Journal that the sponsored listings are now being phased out.Sign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world’s most important and interesting news.More stories from Quartz:"
AMZN,11-28-2018 06:09PM,The bulk of Amazon’s ad dollars are coming from placement in its virtual store aisles,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bulk-amazon-ad-dollars-coming-180411012.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Amazon is poised to challenge the dominance of Google and Facebook in digital advertising. But it’s not just those ad behemoths, which control 57% of the $61 billion US digital advertising market, that Amazon is stealing ad dollars away from. Most of the e-commerce giant’s advertising revenue comes from its core business—retail.The bulk of Amazon’s ad revenue comes from an advertising segment known as trade marketing. Manufacturers of packaged goods, food, and other products pay retailers like Walmart and Target, and grocery stores like Kroger, to get products on shelves and in coveted parts of the store. Think of the colorful displays you see at the ends of store aisles. Those same manufacturers pay for prominent placement in Amazon’s virtual aisles as well. Some are starting to shift their budgets away from brick-and-mortar stores and toward Amazon, The Wall Street Journal reported (paywall) Nov. 27, in wide-ranging story assessing Amazon’s advertising prowess.On Amazon, trade marketing looks a lot like traditional search advertising. Companies can pay to be one of the sponsored products listed high up in the results for searches like “batteries,” or in the product display ads that appear in search results, product detail pages. Advertisers can also pay to be placed in marketing emails. (Some of Amazon’s other ad tactics aren’t as obvious. The Journal reported (paywall) in a separate story Nov. 28 that Amazon had been sneaking sponsored products into baby registries, a practice it is reportedly phasing out.)Trade marketing comprises most of Amazon’s advertising revenue in the US, the Journal wrote, citing a 2018 note from Morgan Stanley analysts. Amazon doesn’t break out its advertising revenue in its earnings reports, instead it includes it in a line item called “other” revenue.During the first nine months of 2018, Amazon generated $6.7 billion in “other” revenue, which is made up mostly of advertising, according to company filings, as well as other services that Amazon did not describe in the filings. It was a lift of 130% from last year. Research firm eMarketer expects the company will post $4.61 billion in ad revenue from the US alone this year, which would make it the third-largest US digital ad platform behind only Google and Facebook.Sign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world’s most important and interesting news.More stories from Quartz:"
AMZN,11-30-2018 06:09PM,Apple Music is coming to the Amazon Echo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-music-coming-amazon-echo-164737324.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Amazon announced today (Dec. 30) that Apple’s streaming music service, Apple Music, will be available on its Echo devices starting Dec. 17.Echo owners will be able to listen to Apple Music playlists, or Beats 1 radio, as easily as they can currently listen to Spotify, Pandora, or any of the other music services available on the Echo.Apple tends not to offer its services outside of its own devices too often, preferring customers to buy its products to access things like iOS, macOS, GarageBand, and other software. While Apple’s revenue from services—like Apple Music subscriptions, and sales of games, movies, and apps—has grown massively in recent years (it’s now Apple’s second-largest business behind the iPhone), it’s still primarily a hardware company. Its services business generated nearly $10 billion last quarter, compared to nearly $52 billion in hardware sales, with over $37 billion of that coming just from iPhone sales.But Apple’s guidance for the current holiday season was lower than analysts had been expecting. Coupled with rumors that its newest phones aren’t shipping in the numbers Apple had expected, and the fact that the company announced that it will no longer break out how many devices it ships each quarter, some analysts have been concerned that there might be weakness in Apple’s core business. This all helped contribute to one of the worst months Apple’s stock has seen in a decade, with its share price now effectively flat over the last year.Perhaps Apple sees partnering with Amazon as a necessary move to keep customers using its services even when they’re not using its devices. Amazon has sold around (paywall) 50 million Echo devices since the original speaker’s launch in 2014. And while Apple has never specified how its smart speaker, the HomePod, has performed, it’s likely sold only a fraction of that many. (The HomePod is lumped into a business line Apple calls “Other products,” which also features the resurgent Apple Watch, and the increasingly popular AirPods headphones.) With its services business growing, and iPhone sales possibly faltering, this may be a canny move to keep users locked into its services even when it can’t keep them locked into its hardware ecosystem.Apple wasn’t immediately available to comment on the news, or whether Apple Music would be coming to other devices in the future.Sign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world’s most important and interesting news.More stories from Quartz:"
AMZN,12-03-2018 12:09PM,"Could Alphabet Stock Be Crippled by Major Risks, Tough Challenge?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-alphabet-stock-crippled-major-201106735.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.In Reid Hoffman’s excellent book, Blitzscaling: The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies, he looks at what it takes to supercharge a company’s growth and dominate an industry. Of course, dominating industries leads to massive stock gains.One of the companies that Hoffman covers is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). He notes: “At Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin built great search algorithms, but it was their innovations to the search engine business model – specifically, considering relevance and performance when displaying advertisements rather than simply renting space to the highest bidder – that drove their massive success.”Hoffman’s assessment is spot-on. As of now, GOOGL stock is worth a staggering $757 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet maintaining success is never easy. The tech market is full of examples of epic implosions. Take a look at what happened to Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB). Not long ago, they seemed to be unbeatable leaders in the lucrative mobile phone market.So what might go wrong for GOOGL stock? Where are its vulnerabilities? Well, interestingly enough, the main threats to GOOGL may not necessarily be from scrappy startups. Instead, the real problem for GOOGL stock could ultimately come from other huge tech companies, such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).Keep in mind that AMZN has taken a low-profile approach to its move into the online ad business. But nowadays, AMZN’s efforts in that area are getting too hard to hide. The fact is that Amazon’s online ad business is becoming a major source of its growth.According to research from eMarketer, Amazon’s ad revenues are projected to double this year to $5.83 billion. And based on analysis from Cowen & Co, the e-commerce giant’s ad business could ultimately be worth as much as $28.4 billion. If that forecast – which does seem reasonable – proves accurate, then GOOGL stock could easily come under a great deal of pressure.AMZN has a unique advantage: its massive e-commerce platform. When people visit the site or its other apps and platforms, they are generally focused on making purchases. That is certainly an attractive attribute for any advertiser. By comparison, when a user does a Google search, he or she may have other reasons to do so i.e. to learn something or to be entertained.AMZN also has tremendous amounts of purchase data on its customers. This will likely be a major competitive advantage for AMZN, as the data should enable advertisers to enjoy much higher conversion rates.AMZN is not the only factor that could weigh on GOOGL stock. The company is also facing some other major challenges. For example, its privacy policies and alleged anticompetitive practices are being scrutinized. The European Union has already levied a $5 billion fine against the company because of its actions involving its Android operating system.But this may be just the beginning. GOOGL is also involved in litigation in the EU regarding the company’s potential violations of the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) act.Interestingly enough, monetary damages may not be the real problem for Alphabet and GOOGL stock. Rather, the major harm to Alphabet stock is likely to come from restrictions on the company’s use of data, which could ultimately make it much more difficult for GOOGL to monetize its platforms in Europe.Over the years, GOOGL has been trying to become involved in businesses other than digital ads. Yet its results have been mixed. Just look at the company’s cloud segment. Despite making substantial investments in its cloud business, GOOGL has not been able to gain much traction in the cloud space, as it has just 3.3% of the market. Conversely, AMZN has a 51.8% share and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) share is 13.3%. Note that GOOGL recently hired a new executive to head its cloud unit.Now for the most part, the major risks facing GOOGL stock will not have a material impact on the stock for some time. And GOOGL still has some major advantages, including a huge cash position as well as multiple, highly successful assets like YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, Android and Play. But if GOOGL wants to continue to thrive, the company should start acting more aggressively, and it should do so as soon as possible.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling. Follow him on Twitter at @ttaulli. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare BrokersThe post Could Alphabet Stock Be Crippled by Major Risks, Tough Challenge? appeared first on InvestorPlace."

So, let’s see what to expect from Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s quarterly financial results Tuesday to help us understand if the company might be able to keep this momentum going.Overall, some of the biggest names in tech from Nvidia NVDA to Apple AAPL have seen their stock prices fall during the last few months. Yet, the tech sector as a whole has performed rather well during third-quarter earnings season, with total earnings up 27% from the same period last year on 13% higher revenues (also read: Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard).Last quarter, HPE saw its revenues jump 4% to $7.76 billion. However, the company, which was officially formed in 2015 after Hewlett-Packard split into HPE and HP Inc. HPQ, has failed to live up to investor expectations. The firm sells enterprise-level servers, storage, and networking gear, and has lost ground to the likes of Cisco CSCO and Dell DVMT. Plus, the cloud-computing age has seen Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT eat away at its business.OutlookWith all that said, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s quarterly earnings are projected to pop 2.5% to reach $7.85 billion, according to our Zacks Consensus Estimate. Better yet, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are excepted to soar 48.3% to reach $0.43 per share. Still, we need to know how likely it is that HPE tops our quarterly earnings estimate since this could determine how the company’s stock trades following its release.Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to help us. The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.HPE is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Unfortunately, this means that our model is inconclusive. But, investors should note that the company has topped our quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing four periods.Hewlett Packard Enterprise is set to release its fiscal fourth quarter financial results after the closing bell Tuesday.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

At the same time, Apple traded up 2.1 percent, giving it a market capitalization of $864.8 billion.Microsoft, which on Friday closed above Apple's market capitalization for the first time in eight years, was up 0.9 percent, leaving its stock market value at $859.0 billion, third in the group.Amazon's lead lasted only a few seconds. At the close, Apple was back on top with a 3.49 percent increase in its stock that put its total value at $877 billion. It was followed by Amazon, up 4.86 percent with a market capitalization of $866.6 billion, and then Microsoft, up 1.08 percent and a stock market value of $860.4 billion.The tight race between the trio of high-powered technology stocks coincided with a broad stock market rally after the United States and China agreed on a temporary truce in their ongoing trade dispute.Apple in August became the first U.S. publicly listed company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, but its share price has fallen sharply in recent months as investors worried that demand for iPhones was losing steam.Its market capitalization overtook Microsoft's in 2010 as Microsoft struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones like the iPhone.Amazon's stock has recovered most of the ground it lost after the online retailer in October forecast disappointing sales for the holiday quarter.Although it is down about 13 percent from its Sept. 4 record-high close, in the year to date Amazon's stock is up 51 percent, compared with a 31 percent rise for Microsoft and Apple's 9 percent increase.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by G Crosse and Lisa Shumaker)"

BIDU,12-03-2018 10:09AM,Some Pre-Earnings Homework for Momo Stock Followers,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pre-earnings-homework-momo-stock-183433992.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Growth isn’t the issue for China’s Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO); it has been able to do that in spades. Rather, the yardstick by which Momo stock has been and still is judged is the pace of its growth. Anything less than red-hot forward progress has been viewed as a letdown, despite topping earnings estimates in each of its past eleven quarters.It would also be naive to pretend it hasn’t been lumped in with the likes of Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and other Chinese tech stocks. The escalating trade war and subsequent economic slowdown for the world’s second-biggest economy had spooked investors.With the tariff showdown currently taking a cease-fire and likely to be closer to its end than not though, in addition to a garden-variety oversold condition, Thursday’s earnings report may well light a fire under Momo stock again. The chart’s certainly set up for such a move.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe key will be what kind of mood investors are in at the time… will they be optimistic, or pessimistic?Originally scheduled for Wednesday morning, China’s online dating platform Momo rescheduled the report on Monday in light of the fact that U.S. markets will be closed on Dec. 5 to honor the passing of former President George HW Bush. The report and corresponding conference call are now both slated for Thursday morning, before the market opens.The delay won’t change the numbers, however, which on a relative basis should be impressive enough.As of the latest look, analysts are calling for third-quarter earnings of 54 cents per share on sales of $533.6 million. Both will be up from the year-ago comparables of 45 cents per share of MOMO stock, and a top line of $354.5 million, extending a long streak of sizable organic and non-organic growth.The numbers, of course, are only part of the story.Though Momo has introduced its own tweaks to make its take on love connections more captivating, it has also bought some of its growth. Early this year it acquired Tantan, the so-called Tinder of China, making it more like its diversified western counterpart Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), which operates Match.com, Tinder, Our Time and other online dating sites. Integration with Tantan continues.Also, like any other social networking company, current and would-be owners of MOMO stock will be looking at the number of regular users the company’s sites boasts and how long they’re logged in. During the second quarter of this year, its platforms counted 108 million regular monthly users, and total paying users of its live video service reached 11.6 million a quarter earlier. Both figures will need to grow respectably for the third quarter to be considered a success. The amount of time spent per user using the app during the second quarter was up 11% year-over-year, and that number would also ideally increase.The one soft spot that could become a pitfall? Mobile games. Revenue fell 40% during the second quarter … the only arm to see a sales decline.And, the weighing all of those factors will be further impacted by politics.The tariff war had undoubtedly crimped China’s economy at a time when it couldn’t afford to be crimped. A combination of wage headwinds and slowing job growth — or at least fear of them — has proven problematic. The agreement between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping to call a truce to the tariff war can only help put Momo’s third quarter in a positive light, though the agreement between the two leaders is far from binding.While the character and quality of Momo’s earnings are key to the stock’s response to the news, just as telling right now is the technical read in Momo stock. It’s perfectly positioned to bounce, though if it doesn’t, it’s also perfectly positioned to suffer another wave of selling.Click to Enlarge Take a look. Momo has been brutalized since June’s peak, but the selling came to a halt when a familiar support line was met. This may be a subtle sign that there are more than a few bulls waiting in the wings to step back in. They just need the right catalyst.On the other hand, if the read on the numbers is a bearish one and Momo stock breaks below the floor extending back to the late-2016 low, there’s little that can be done to sidestep another round of selling.How things pan out for the stock will largely be a matter of perspective.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

BIDU,11-30-2018 06:10PM,Exclusive: 3 Chinese Google employees express support for censored search engine project,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-3-chinese-google-employees-202114194.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Google's office in Beijing, China. [Credit: Getty Images]When Google CEO Sundar Pichai testifies before Congress next week, he will likely have to address questions about Google’s plans for a censored search engine in China.Since the secret project called “Dragonfly” was exposed in August, the search giant has faced fierce criticism from human rights groups, lawmakers and some employees. An open letter published this week titled “We are Google employees. Google must drop Dragonfly” has attracted more than 600 employees’ signatures.Most of the tech giant’s more than 88,000 employees have stayed silent. And if you look at the signatures on the public letter, there are few Chinese names. While some opt to keep their opinion of the project private because they want to maintain a low profile and others are still weighing both sides, some employees said they support the project and their experience living and receiving education in China give them different perspectives from their non-Chinese colleagues.Three Chinese employees of Google in the U.S. spoke to Yahoo Finance on the condition of anonymity and explained why they think Google’s argument for a censored search engine in China makes sense.A need for an alternativeAt the center of Google’s argument to re-enter China is to provide users with a new, and possibly better search engine. Some Chinese employees agree with their employer on this.“I’m not just a Google employee, I’m also the future customer of the potential search engine Google is developing for China when I visit home,” a software engineer at Google told Yahoo Finance. “Baidu’s technology and ethics are not very impressive. If Google could make a comeback to China, it could challenge Baidu’s monopoly and I’ll benefit as a customer.”Baidu, known as “China’s Google”, dominates nearly 70% of China’s search engine market, according to StatCounter Global Stats. But in China, not everyone is a fan of Baidu, which has a notorious bidding rank system that puts prevalent advertisements on the top of search results.Another Google employee believes a new search engine, even a censored one by the government, could help the older generation in China to vet and filter information. Like other search engines, Baidu draws nearly all its revenues from ads, and an estimated 30% of that comes from medical advertising. The Nasdaq-listed company drew public outrage in 2016 when a 21-year-old died from a rare form of cancer after receiving treatment from a hospital whose ads appeared on top of the list on his Baidu search.Already heavily censoredEight years ago, Google exited the Chinese market because of censorship and hacks. Today, China’s internet is more tightly controlled than ever.Some U.S. tech giants have bowed to censorship in the country. LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned networking site, has restricted certain topics of discussion, including the June 4 Tiananmen Square massacre, for its Chinese users. Apple has removed VPN apps in its Chinese app store, a tool widely used to bypass internet censorship.Most censored platforms remain popular in China, and some Google employees say censorship shouldn’t be the dealbreaker for Dragonfly. “Americans are very sensitive to censorship. They think it’s unacceptable, and they won’t develop or make such products. But Chinese people are more likely to accept it,” one employee said.Surveillance is pretty much a known fact in China. WeChat, the most popular messaging app which touts 1 billion users, blocks private messages containing politically sensitive keywords. When users search certain topics related to politics, human rights and religions on Baidu or Weibo (China’s Twitter), they get a message that reads, “According to the relevant laws and regulations, search results for [this phrase] cannot be displayed.”Another worker argued that since Chinese users’ data have been monitored by existing search engines, there is not much harm for Google to join the league but just be more responsible and provide a better product for users.“Not doing it is actually being evil,” said one employee, referring to Google's ""Don't Be Evil"" mantra. “If you can provide a search engine better than the existing one, you can’t drop it just because it’s not perfect.”New revenue streamChina is a business opportunity for Google, the three employees point out. China has more than 800 million internet users and a $3 billion search engine market. The potential is huge as the giant’s home market is maturing.And if Google succeeds financially, so will its investors and employees. Compensation at tech firms is closely tied to the performance of the company’s stock. This year, the stock is only up by 3.7%, a huge contrast from its bull run in 2016.While Dragonfly is a controversial project that may have a negative impact on Google’s reputation and create more uncertainties as the company may need to deal with the Chinese government, some employees said it’s a risk worth taking.“A business project can’t be 100% risk-free and satisfy everyone,” said one employee. “We can’t be too idealistic.”Share your thoughts with Krystal Hu viakrystalh@yahoofinance.comor Follow her onTwitter.Read more:We entered the multi-million dollar business behind your Amazon returnsAmericans who say their finances haven’t improved mostly blame TrumpTrump thinks tariffs are the only way to get China to change, some say no"

BIDU,11-30-2018 06:10PM,China's edge in the tech race is vast amounts of data and public approval,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-apos-edge-tech-race-162600633.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Just over 1.4 billion people live in China. That's a fifth of the world's population and four times as many people as the United States.A vast number of them are sharing medical records, paying for meals and accessing bank accounts through technology on a daily basis, on scale not seen in Europe or the U.S.A number of CEOs, investors and top tech leaders at CNBC's East Tech West conference this week have cited one common theme that binds them all: data is today's gold, more so in China than anywhere else.China's edge in the tech race is vast amounts of data and, more importantly, the willingness of its public to share it.""China is so interesting because there is so much data,"" said Edith Yeung, head of 500 Startups' China unit.""I think there are a lot of Chinese citizens really proud of the fact that we're actually big enough to even be able to compete with the U.S. in terms of AI. And I think it is just a really exciting time to be in China.""She suggested that this willingness from the Chinese public will aid data-hungry firms that are looking to enhance and launch new AI projects.China's tech firms, big and small, are capitalizing on this gold mine of data. Russ Shaw, the founder of tech association Tech London Advocates and Global Tech Advocates, told CNBC via email that China is collecting ""unprecedented amounts of data, unlike anything we are seeing in Europe and the U.S. The combination of advanced technology and government backing has allowed the country to harness the power of its enormous population.""This has shaped public attitudes in China that are somewhat different to those in the West. Holly White, a former U.K. civil servant in Beijing and now a senior consultant with international IP consultancy Rouse, told CNBC in an email that established ""social structures"" have led China's citizens to ""accept a blurred line between private and state involvement in their lives.""China's government has been slowly rolling out guidelines on a digital social-credit system that would rank citizens behavior to give them a ""social"" score, in a similar method to analyzing and rewarding financial credit. The database is reportedly set to be in place nationwide by 2020 with around 30 local authorities already collecting data.""These mass data operations have proved beneficial in a number of areas, none more so than in China's capacity to develop cutting-edge fintech and artificial intelligence. The government has also been quick to realize the potential of Big Data, fueling its smart cities program, and using the information to improve energy efficiency and health standards by reducing pollution levels,"" Shaw said.""People have less inhibitions in sharing personal data, especially when it is seen to benefit their lives or enable them to utilize new innovations,"" White added.Facial recognitionChinese consumers have been speedy adopters of the latest technology thanks to platforms giving access to a wide range of services, from payments to targeted food menus, based on historical data collected by tech firms. China has also adopted facial recognition software for everyday life.The technology has been used for everything from helping police identify and arrest a fugitive in a crowd of 50,000 in southeast China to AI firms publicly displaying the faces of jaywalkers on large LED screens. According to global accounting firm EY, over 1,000 brands across 100,000 locations in China have used features including facial recognition or gamification to engage customers in stores. KFC China launched a ""smile to pay"" facial recognition system for customers to order food in September 2017 with the help of internet search engine Baidu.Baidu is currently experimenting with AI, but its humble beginnings reveal how early players grabbed a stranglehold on data dominance. Back in 2000, venture capitalist Jixun Foo invested in Baidu, which has now evolved into China's largest search engine.""When I invested in Baidu in 2000, I wasn't sure where Google was. I thought it was B2B (business-to-business) services. I said information services had demand and that search has value. That is the underlying thesis,"" Jixun said at the East Tech West summit .China's tech landscape has morphed considerably since, boasting the world's biggest technology companies, including e-commerce giant Alibaba, Tencent with its WeChat app registered with 1 billion users, alongside Baidu. All three internet behemoths have grown so big that they now dominate every aspect of China's tech landscape with investments ranging from e-gaming, driverless cars and media companies.According to the China Internet Report , created by 500 Startups' Yeung, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have invested in over 400 companies combined. That means almost all the big data is controlled by industry heavyweights, making it very difficult for small start-ups to get hold of that data.Xin Song, founder of an AI-focused blockchain platform called Bottos, told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal that the solution to breaking that stranglehold and providing data privacy could be in blockchain.""With blockchain technology… people can provide those data, and with the traceability and the transparency of the data usage in the future, people in the world and people in the blockchain community (will be) willing to contribute their individual data.""More From CNBC"

Proceeds from the offering will go toward content and technology investments as well as capped call transactions to reduce potential dilution to shareholders upon conversion of the notes.The proposal arrived just eight months after iQiyi  pulled in $2.25 billion from an initial public offering on NASDAQ that marked one of the largest flotations by a Chinese tech company in recent years.IQiyi has seen its subscription base grow thanks to a series of blockbuster titles — including “Story of Yanxi Palace,” a record-breaking TV drama about backstabbing concubines — but that comes at a cost.

BIDU,11-28-2018 06:10PM,GRAPHIC-Asian firms set for first quarterly profit drop since mid-2016,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graphic-asian-firms-set-first-003112575.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.(Repeats with no changes to text)By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav DograNov 28 (Reuters) - Holiday-quarter profit at Asian companies is likely to drop for the first time in more than two years, following a small rise in the July-September period, as slowing exports, falling factory output and the Sino-U.S. trade war take their toll.Analysts expect profit to drop by an average 8 percent for about 2,000 Asian companies over October-December from a year ago, weighed down by slowing growth for firms in the technology, telecommunications and auto sectors, Refinitiv data shows.The last time things were so dire was the second quarter of 2016, when profit fell 9.4 percent as oil prices recovered from multi-year lows hit earlier that year, pressuring profit margins, a Reuters analysis of more than 5,000 firms showed.""Fundamental risks that investors have anticipated since Q2 are starting to show in numbers,"" Mixo Das, a strategist at JP Morgan said, adding that signs of margin pressure were emerging.Profit growth in the September quarter had slipped to 2.4 percent after a 15.7 percent rise in the first two quarters of the year, on an average.The outlook for global growth in 2019 dimmed for the first time last month, according to Reuters polls of economists who said trade protectionism and tightening financial conditions would trigger the next downturn.Markets worldwide are bracing for a chill.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan has slumped 14.6 percent so far this year, more than double the decline in the World index.Analysts for Asian companies slashed their fourth-quarter and 2019 earnings expectations by 7.3 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, in the last 90 days, Refinitiv data showed.""Growth slowdown is coming from a very high base as 2017 was a year of recovery,"" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale, adding that companies are likely to cut their 2019 outlook after a disappointing fourth quarter.The effects from higher tariffs and softer growth in China are more tangible in the fourth quarter, he said.China and the United States have been locked in a debilitating trade war for months, in which the countries have imposed tit-fot-tat tariffs on billions of dollars of imports.The effect has been felt most keenly by tech companies and firms that supply them with components, as well as auto makers who do not produce cars locally.Corporate earnings in Japan are expected to plunge by nearly a quarter over October-December, their first drop since early 2016, on slowing profit growth at telecom firms SoftBank Group Corp and NTT Docomo Inc and the three top carmakers - Toyota, Nissan and Honda.Echoing a slowing economy, China corporate earnings growth is expected to fall 4.4 percent versus a 3.5 percent growth in the third quarter, as companies including tech giants Tencent Holdings Ltd and Baidu Inc register softening profits.With oil at its lowest in over a year, analysts expect energy firms' profits to come under pressure in the current quarter, taking away what was the brightest spot in the third quarter.(Reporting By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Himani Sarkar)"

BIDU,11-28-2018 06:10PM,Stocks Hold Onto Gains Ahead of Powell Speech,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-hold-onto-gains-ahead-141502918.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The major indices couldn’t replicate yesterday’s post-Thanksgiving rally, but they managed to hold onto all the gains and even add a little despite a weak open.  The Dow slumped more than 220 points at its worst on Tuesday, but the back half of the session was mostly higher as defensive areas improved. The index rose 0.44% (or about 108 points) to 24,748.73. The S&P advanced 0.33% to 2682.17.  The NASDAQ was much more erratic than its counterparts but managed to eke out a gain of 0.01% to 7082.7. While that’s nothing to write home about, correction-fatigued investors should be at least content that the beleaguered index held onto all of yesterday’s 2% surge.  Everyone’s talking about trade as we inch closer and closer to the G-20 meeting that begins on Friday. On the one hand, President Trump and White House officials stress the importance of communication with Chinese President Xi and the possibility of some sort of breakthrough. On the other hand though, they don’t want expectations too high and Trump is letting everyone know that the plan is still to implement more and higher tariffs moving forward if there’s no deal.  But before we go to Argentina, we’ll be going to New York where Jerome Powell is scheduled to give a speech. As with trade, there’s not a lot of optimism on Wall Street that the Fed Chair will lighten up on more rate hikes next year in the wake of this correction… but you never know. If his language is deemed to be more dovish than before, we might be in store for three straight days of gains to start this week. Stay tuned…  Today's Portfolio Highlights:  Counterstrike: The market looks like it might rise into the G-20 meeting that begins on Friday, so Jeremy thought this was a good time to pick up a couple names. Firstly, the editor added a 6% allocation in online marketplace Lending Tree (TREE), which has been halved from its 2018 highs. But it could be poised for a sharp move higher as a strong quarterly report has exposed its oversold position.  The other buy was a 10% allocation in Nice Ltd. (NICE), a provider of enterprise software solutions that also reported a good quarter. Shares did not plunge on the news, which is actually pretty encouraging given the sharp selloffs. Both of these stocks are Zacks Rank #1s (Strong Buys). Jeremy strongly suggests using limit orders in these moves, so read the complete commentary for more instructions.  Surprise Trader: Athletic apparel has performed really well for the portfolio this quarter. So why deviate from what’s working? Dave went back to the well on Tuesday by adding Lululemon (LULU) with a 12.5% allocation. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) yoga-inspired apparel company is part of a space in the top 17% of the Zacks Industry Rank. The editor really likes its positive Earnings ESP of 4.89% for the report coming after the bell on December 5. LULU has beaten for six straight quarters with an average surprise of more than 19% in the past four. The editor thinks it is primed for another outperformance. Read the full write-up for more.  TAZR Trader: Sure, the market was up a bit on Tuesday, but this isn’t the bounce that Kevin was looking for. He thinks instead of volume buying there’s just a half-hearted optimism that some sort of progress on China trade will be made at the G-20 this weekend. Therefore, he sold the oldest batch of SMART Global Holdings (SGH) to secure a 12% return. The editor also decided to get out of ProShares Ultra Pro QQQ (TQQQ) as all the best cyber shopping news could barely push Amazon to $1600. The position brought a gain of 4% in just one day. Read the complete commentary for more on today’s moves.   Zacks Short List: The portfolio short-covered Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) on Tuesday for a nice return of 23.3%. It also got out of Catalent (CTLT). The new buys this week that replaced these names are Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).

BIDU,11-27-2018 06:10PM,Hedge Funds Soured on This Chinese Internet Giant in Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-soured-chinese-internet-035422753.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Although the masses and most of the financial media blame hedge funds for their exorbitant fee structure and disappointing performance, these investors have proved to have great stock picking abilities over the years (that's why their assets under management continue to swell). We believe hedge fund sentiment should serve as a crucial tool of an individual investor’s stock selection process, as it may offer great insights of how the brightest minds of the finance industry feel about specific stocks. After all, these people have access to smartest analysts and expensive data/information sources that individual investors can't match. So should one consider investing in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)? The smart money sentiment can provide an answer to this question.When it comes to Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey's database were bearish on the Chinese search and video giant in Q3, as a net total of 14 hedge funds sold off their BIDU holdings. Anthony Bozza‘s Lakewood Capital Management was not one of them, raising its stake by 12% to 1.53 million shares, with Baidu being its top stock pick. In the fund's Q2 investor letter, Lakewood shared its updated thoughts on several of its long and short positions, including Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAXN), Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE:APO), AeroVironment, Inc. (NYSE:AVAV), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), stating that the latter could hit $415 per share by 2020, more than double its current price.""In 2020, we believe Baidu’s core business will generate approximately $16 of earnings per share. At 20x this estimate (a conservative multiple given the attributes of this business), the core search and newsfeed business would be valued at $320 per share. By the end of 2019, we forecast Baidu’s net cash position plus its public stakes in iQiyi and Ctrip (net of a 25% discount) will amount to $95 per share. Adding this to our value for the core business equates to a total stock price of $415 per share, nearly 60% above current levels, in less than two years,"" the fund wrote in its investor letter.To most shareholders, hedge funds are perceived as worthless, outdated financial vehicles of the past. While there are over 8,000 funds trading today, our researchers hone in on the moguls of this group, approximately 700 funds. It is estimated that this group of investors have their hands on the lion's share of the smart money's total asset base, and by tracking their finest stock picks, Insider Monkey has formulated several investment strategies that have historically outstripped the market. Insider Monkey's flagship hedge fund strategy defeated the S&P 500 index by 6 percentage points per year since its inception in May 2014 through early November 2018. We were able to generate large returns even by identifying short candidates. Our portfolio of short stocks lost 26.1% since February 2017 even though the market was up nearly 19% during the same period. We just shared a list of 11 short targets in our latest quarterly update.At Q3's end, a total of 53 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a 21% drop from one quarter earlier. Below, you can check out the change in hedge fund sentiment towards BIDU over the last 13 quarters. With hedge funds' capital changing hands, there exists an ""upper tier"" of noteworthy hedge fund managers who were adding to their stakes substantially (or already accumulated large positions).More specifically, First Pacific Advisors LLC was the largest shareholder of Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), with a stake worth $505.5 million reported as of the end of September. Trailing First Pacific Advisors LLC was Fisher Asset Management, which amassed a stake valued at $382.6 million. Cantillon Capital Management and Lakewood Capital Management were also very fond of the stock, giving the stock large weights in their portfolios.Because Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has experienced a decline in interest from the entirety of the hedge funds we track, it's safe to say that there were a few fund managers that slashed their positions entirely heading into Q3. Interestingly, Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global said goodbye to the largest position of the ""upper crust"" of funds watched by Insider Monkey, totaling close to $216.5 million in stock. Matt Sirovich and Jeremy Mindich's fund, Scopia Capital, also said goodbye to its stock, about $123.4 million worth. These bearish behaviors are important to note, as aggregate hedge fund interest fell by 14 funds heading into Q3.Let's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU). We will take a look at NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), Sony Corporation (NYSE:SNE), and Vale SA (NYSE:VALE). This group of stocks' market caps are closest to BIDU's market cap.[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position NEE,32,1164363,1 PBR,28,2056204,0 SNE,27,709311,3 VALE,35,2585315,3 [/table]As you can see these stocks had an average of 31 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $1.63 billion. That figure was $4.05 billion in BIDU's case. Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Sony Corporation (NYSE:SNE) is the least popular one with only 27 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is more popular among hedge funds. Considering that hedge funds are fond of this stock in relation to its market cap peers, it may be a good idea to analyze it in detail and potentially include it in your portfolio.Disclosure: None.

BIDU,11-27-2018 06:10PM,These 3 Chinese Tech Stocks Could Rebound in 2019,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-chinese-tech-stocks-could-004000307.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.This year has been brutal for Chinese tech stocks due to escalating trade tensions and a depreciating yuan. But many high-growth tech stocks were tossed out with the bathwater and now trade at historically low valuations. Let's check out three hated stocks that could rebound sharply in 2019 as the near-term headwinds fade.Tencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY), the largest video game maker and social media company in China, lost 30% of its value this year. The biggest challenge for the company was a government crackdown on video game addiction, which included a temporary freeze on all new gaming approvals and forced companies to impose tighter age and playtime restrictions.Tencent/Riot Games' League of Legends. Image source: Riot Games.That crackdown caused the growth of Tencent's online gaming revenue, which accounted for nearly a third of its top line last quarter, to drop from the positive double digits to a single-digit decline. Its total revenue rose 24% annually last quarter on the strength of its advertising business, but that represented its slowest growth rate in three years.To counter that slowdown, Tencent restructured its businesses to focus on the growth of its digital platforms, cloud services, online payments, and other higher-growth units. It also reduced its spending on the development and marketing of new games. This strategic shift enabled Tencent to post 30% earnings growth last quarter (15% excluding investment-related gains), which crushed analyst expectations for single-digit growth.Chinese regulators are expected to resume new gaming approvals in the first half of 2019. When that happens, Tencent's gaming revenue growth will accelerate again as it faces easy year-over-year comparisons -- which should cause the stock to rally.This has also been a year to forget for JD (NASDAQ: JD), the second largest e-commerce player in China after Alibaba, as its stock dropped 50% on concerns about decelerating growth, surging expenses, and an unresolved rape allegation against its founder and CEO Richard Liu. But that decline also reduced JD's price-to-sales ratio to less than 0.5 -- a fire-sale valuation for a company expected to generate more than 20% revenue growth next year.JD's growth in revenue, gross merchandise volume, and active customers all decelerated over the past year as demand for large-ticket consumer electronics and appliances waned. Its gross and operating margins also contracted last quarter as it invested more money into its online marketplace, digital services, and logistics network.However, JD believes that it can grow its higher-margin service revenue (which surged 49% year-over-year last quarter and accounted for 10% of its top line) by offering its logistics services to third-party retailers; expanding its Prime-like ""JD Plus"" program; and launching more ""mini programs"" on Tencent's WeChat, the top mobile messaging app in China.A JD.com delivery robot. Image source: JD.com.The growth of that higher-margin revenue could offset JD's slower marketplace sales, boost its margins, and generate more consistent earnings growth over the next few quarters. That growth would cause the stock to rally, especially if Liu is exonerated.Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) owns the top online search engine in China, which is tethered to an ecosystem of portals, mobile apps, and cloud services. Yet Baidu's stock slumped more than 20% this year on concerns about weaker ad spending, the depreciation of the yuan, and Alphabet's Google potentially returning to China with a censored search engine.Some of those concerns are valid, but Baidu remains the 800-pound gorilla of China's online advertising market. Its online marketing revenue grew 18% annually last quarter, its number of active online marketing customers climbed 7%, and its revenue per online marketing customer jumped 12%. Its traffic acquisition costs accounted for only 11% of its revenue, so it clearly isn't breaking the bank to lock in those customers. Baidu's total revenue rose 27% during the quarter, and its non-GAAP net income surged 47%.Those growth rates look solid, but Baidu expects its growth to decelerate in the fourth quarter. That conservative forecast kept investors away from the stock, but analysts still expect its revenue and earnings to rise 16% and 11%, respectively, next year in dollar terms. Those are still decent growth rates for a stock that trades at 17 times forward earnings.Baidu is often considered a bellwether of the Chinese tech industry, so any whiff of progress in the trade talks between the U.S. and China will likely cause this stock to rally.More From The Motley FoolSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

BIDU,11-27-2018 06:10PM,The Cloud Tailwinds for Alibaba Stock Shouldn’t Be Forgotten,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloud-tailwinds-alibaba-stock-shouldn-153117501.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has been in the spotlight lately amid constant trade war headlines and some investors have thrown BABA stock in the gutter as a result, but now might be the time for investors to take a second look.The company recently reported yet another quarter of close to triple-digit growth in the cloud segment. The cloud business grew from RMB 2,975 million to RMB 5,667 million or $825 million in the latest quarter. This has increased the revenue on an annualized basis to over $3 billion.Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang mentioned in a CNBC interview that in the future, the cloud computing business would be the “main business” of BABA. And Alibaba stock should gain a strong tailwind as the cloud segment delivers better margins in the next few quarters.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe growth potential within the cloud segment is immense. BABA has a number of advantages in this segment. Chinese regulators do not allow international companies to set up independent cloud business within China. This reduces the competitive field for Alibaba. It is only competing against Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) for cloud customers within China. BABA already has a close relationship with thousands of small enterprises through its commerce platform. Hence, it becomes easier for the company to develop cloud business from a client-centric perspective.Over the past few quarters, Alibaba has been expanding rapidly in international regions. It has numerous subsidiaries in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Most of the investments made by Alibaba are in tech-heavy sectors like e-commerce, digital payments, online grocery, media, logistics and more.It has invested billions of dollars in companies like Lazada, Tokopedia, Paytm, Big Basket and others. Most of these companies will have heavy cloud computing needs. Alibaba would generally be the first choice for these startups while expanding their operations.Alibaba is also expanding in Europe. It recently opened two cloud computing facilities in London. There are data centers in other key locations like Frankfurt in Germany and Dubai. In these international regions, the cloud business of BABA is still in the early stages. We can expect a long growth runway for the company as it increases the cloud locations and adds new clients in these regions.There is a lot of macro tailwinds for BABA stock in the cloud segment. Gartner has forecasted that the public cloud services will grow by more than 20% over the next few years.Fig: Growth in cloud services. Source: GartnerThe fastest growth will be in Infrastructure Services called IaaS. This is one of the biggest business verticals for Alibaba’s cloud segment. Alibaba provides massive scale for businesses looking to use public cloud options. Gartner also estimated that the top 10 cloud providers will corner 70% of market share by 2021, up from 50% in 2016. This means we should see more business going to already established players.Earlier this year, it was reported that Alibaba has displaced IBM (NYSE:IBM) in cloud market share rankings. There are only three other major cloud companies bigger than Alibaba. They are Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Earlier this year, Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, mentioned that the company was hitting $1 billion revenue per quarter or $4 billion in annualized revenue. But the growth rate of Google is lower than Alibaba. If BABA keeps the current growth trajectory in the cloud segment, it should surpass Google in 2019. This will catapult BABA among the top three cloud players.Alibaba is still reporting losses on the cloud segment. The EBITA in the cloud segment went from RMB -164 million to RMB -232 million. However, due to faster revenue growth, the EBITA margin improved marginally from -5% to -4%. But the bigger story is the future trend within margins of this segment.Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS has shown that larger scale helps in rapid improvement in margins. In Q4 2014, Amazon started showing a massive jump in margins of its AWS business. In Q3 2014, AWS revenue was $1,169 million and operating income of $98 million. In Q4 2014, AWS revenue was $1,420 million and operating income was $240 million.Hence, the operating margin went from 8.3% in Q3 2014 to 16.9% in the next quarter. Since then, the margin improvement continued even as the revenue growth was high. This was the main reason behind the bullish run in the stock from $300 in early 2015 to $1,500 by mid-2018.Alibaba stock is also close to this revenue rate. The cloud segment of BABA should be hitting over $1 billion in revenue in the next few quarters. At this rate, we should start seeing substantial improvement in the margins of this segment.In the recent quarter, Amazon’s AWS reported revenue of $6,679 million and an operating income of $2,077 million. This shows that the operating margin of this segment was 31.1%. Alibaba’s cloud business is very similar to AWS. This should allow the company to deliver margins close to AWS as it scales up.By 2020, Alibaba’s cloud business could be close to $10 billion revenue rate. A modest 20% margin on this revenue base would give BABA’s cloud an income of $2 billion. For a business that is growing at a rapid pace and has a long runway for growth, the valuation multiple should be quite high. Taking a conservative estimate of 50 to 70 times the income, the stand-alone valuation of the cloud segment should be $100 billion to $140 billion.Currently, Alibaba stock has a market cap of less than $400 billion. As the cloud segment becomes a bigger part of the total revenue base of Alibaba, Wall Street could give greater focus on cloud performance. Improvements in cloud margins along with faster revenue growth should increase the bullish sentiment toward BABA stock.Alibaba’s cloud business is at an inflection point. It is reporting over $3 billion in revenue on an annualized basis with close to triple-digit growth. With this trajectory, the cloud segment should hit $10 billion revenue rate by 2020. At the same time, higher scale improves the margin performance of the cloud business. This has been shown by Amazon’s AWS in 2015.Even with a much lower margin than AWS, Alibaba’s cloud could be worth more than $100 billion by 2020 on a standalone basis. This should provide a good bullish momentum to BABA stock.As of this writing, Rohit Chhatwal did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare BrokersThe post The Cloud Tailwinds for Alibaba Stock Shouldn’t Be Forgotten appeared first on InvestorPlace."
BZUN,12-02-2018 06:10PM,5 Top Stocks to Buy in December,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stocks-buy-december-151500669.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Through the end of November, the S&P 500 is up 3.2% since the start of the year. If the recent selling continues -- stocks are down almost 6% since early October -- 2018 is on track to be the worst year for stocks since 2015. And between rising interest rates, some signs that global trade is weakening, and a litany of other concerns, investors are concerned that the nearly decade-long bull run could be coming to an end.And while there's no predicting what stocks will do over the next month, the coming quarters, or even the next few years, it's reasonable to expect stocks to continue doing what they have historically done: outperform every other investment class over the long-term.Even better, the recent sell-off has created some great opportunities to buy. A select group of Motley Fool contributors have identified five stocks that investors should put on their short lists: Baozun (NASDAQ: BZUN), GrubHub (NYSE: GRUB), Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE: BIP), Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT: XLF), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN).The market's short-term sell-off has created a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Image source: Getty Images.Jason Hall (Baozun): Since peaking about six months ago, share of e-commerce platform services provider Baozun are down almost 50%, and that's after a double-digit recovery over the past couple of weeks.BZUN data by YChartsSo what gives? In short, it's tough being a tech stock right now, and even tougher being a Chinese tech stock. Between fears of a trade war with the U.S. and concerns about slowing economic growth in China, the second half of 2018 has been dominated by selling.And while China's economy isn't growing at the rates it has in the past, and Chinese tech stocks are potentially exposed to the impact of trade actions by the U.S. because of China's spotty record of honoring intellectual property rights, Baozun is way too oversold at this point, considering its strength, the powerful niche it's steadily creating a massive position in, and the reality that China's consumer middle class is already one of the world's biggest and still growing quickly.Baozun displayed its chops once again in the third quarter, delivering 25% revenue growth and 47% adjusted earnings-per-share growth, yet another quarter of double-digit improvement in both areas.At recent prices, you can buy Baozun for around 21 times expected forward earnings. That's a cheaper multiple than the S&P 500 trades for on a trailing basis today, and Baozun is likely to grow earnings at a much higher rate than the U.S. stock market for years to come.Brian Feroldi (GrubHub): Imagine if a platform company that you're quite fond of posted the following numbers in its most recent earnings report:Would you expect that company's stock to be down nearly 45% from its recent high? Believe it or not, that's exactly what has happened to GrubHub's stock in the past three months.If the company was in trouble, then I would agree with the huge decline. But the results indicate that GrubHub's food delivery platform remains as popular as ever. The number of active diners grew 67% to 16.4 million. Average orders per day grew 37% to 416,000. Total food sales soared 40% to $1.2 billion. These figures tell me that the company is still growing strong.So what can explain the slump? The most likely answer is a combination of a stretch valuation and management's call for higher upcoming spending. Management stated on its call with investors that it plans on ramping up spending on marketing and delivery expansion by another $20 million to $30 million in the current quarter. Traders might be worried that the company's torrid profit growth rate might slow as a result.My view is that Wall Street is missing the forest for the trees. GrubHub's business is growing like gangbusters, and the company is currently in a land-grab mode as it looks to secure its spot as the industry's top dog. While shares still can't be called classically ""cheap"", I think that right now is a great time for growth investors to buy a fast-growing market leader at a nice discount.Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Infrastructure Partners): After delivering market-crushing returns in 2017, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners has cooled off considerably in 2018. Through the end of November, the global infrastructure giant lost about 14% of its value. That's mainly because the company's growth engine sputtered this year, as earnings have dipped the past two quarters after it sold an electricity transmission business in Chile earlier in the year.However, a reacceleration is about to get under way, driven by the anticipated reinvestment of those proceeds into six acquisitions. Those deals, which should close over the next few months, will boost Brookfield Infrastructure's earnings by 20% while setting it up to grow at a faster pace in the coming years.In the meantime, investors can pick up shares of Brookfield Infrastructure for a bargain price. The company estimates that it should generate $3.60 per unit in annualized cash flow when that last deal closes next year, which implies that it currently sells for less than 11 times cash flow. Meanwhile, earnings should grow from that level by around a 7.5% annual pace over the next several years, assuming it doesn't make any additional acquisitions, which should enable it to increase its 4.9%-yielding distribution by a 5% to 9% yearly pace. That growing income stream should give Brookfield Infrastructure the fuel needed to generate market-beating total returns -- especially when factoring in its low valuation, which should improve as earnings reaccelerate -- making it a great stock to buy this month.Matt Frankel, CFP (Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF): As we head into December, I have my eye on several bank stocks. Bank of America is down by about 10% over the past three months despite impressive profitability and efficiency. Goldman Sachs is trading for less than its book value for the first time in more than two years. And there is little not to like about the recent results from JPMorgan Chase. I could go on.The point is that most of the banking industry looks extremely attractive right now. For 2018, the financial sector has underperformed the S&P 500 by more than six percentage points, and there are some major catalysts that could fuel profits. Sure, most of the benefits of tax reform are now reflected in bank earnings, but rising interest rates and the strong economy should keep earnings moving higher.The Federal Reserve has raised rates eight times in the current cycle, but it hasn't had quite the effect investors had anticipated on bank interest margins -- not yet, at least. And, the tight labor market and growing wages in the U.S. should create more demand for loans and other banking products.So instead of trying to pick just one bank, it could be a smarter idea to just buy them all. Of course, it's not practical for most investors to buy a handful of bank stocks all at once, so I'm looking at the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF -- a low-fee index fund that allows you to benefit if the entire banking industry performs well.Todd Campbell (Amazon.com): If you've been on the sidelines and not owned Amazon.com yet, now could be the perfect time to make the leap and buy its shares. There's no telling where Amazon will trade from here, but its shares have declined about 17% since early September, and there's good reason to believe buying it now could pay off.The company generates about one-third of its total annual revenue in November and December, and this holiday season, the National Retail Federation estimates that retail sales will increase 4.1% from last year. That estimate, however, may seriously underestimate the potential upside for e-commerce, given that internet retailers are increasingly accounting for a larger percentage of retail spending.According to data crunchers at Adobe Analytics, e-commerce sales could grow 14.8% to $124.1 billion this holiday season, and I suspect that a lot of that growth will head Amazon's way.On Nov. 27, Amazon reported that its post-Thanksgiving weekend sales broke previous records and that Cyber Monday was the single best day in its history. During the five-day stretch from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, Amazon customers ordered a whopping 180 million items, and Amazon's best-selling product was its own Echo Dot virtual assistant.Assuming this holiday sales momentum continues, and I think it will, then it seems likely Amazon's next earnings report will be a good one. The past doesn't guarantee the future, but a solid report could inspire a rally, especially considering Amazon's shares have posted gains in seven of the past 10 years during Q1, after gaining in just five of the past 10 Q4s.The longer-term opportunity for shareholders doesn't seem to have peaked for Amazon, either. Despite e-commerce's popularity, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that e-commerce still accounted for only 9% of total U.S. retail sales in the third quarter. That suggests there's still plenty of opportunity ahead of the company, making this company a top stock to buy on its recent drop.More From The Motley FoolJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

ENV,11-28-2018 06:10PM,"Alliance Data Eyes Strategic Options for Epsilon, Conversant",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alliance-data-eyes-strategic-options-140502262.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Alliance Data Systems Corporation ADS is looking to explore strategic alternatives for its Epsilon business and its digital media arm Conversant. The strategic alternatives include potential divestiture of the business.In 2004, Alliance Data acquired Epsilon Data Management, a leading provider of integrated direct marketing solutions, for $300 million to ramp up its marketing capabilities and fortify presence in North America. Conversant, a leading global provider of data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions, was acquired by Alliance Data in a cash stock transaction in 2013 and was merged with Epsilon.The Epsilon business has been witnessing waning sales for some time. The top line, through the first nine months of 2018, decreased 4% attributable to declines in lower margin agency and site-based display product offerings. In fact, continued weakness in certain Epsilon product offerings and the initial impact of strategic initiatives induced the company to lower its 2018 net revenue and pro-forma revenues guidance to $7.9 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) financial transaction service provider noted that enhancing Epsilon's exclusive assets requires growth and capital allocation strategies. However, its operations differ from its Card Services business (contributing lion’s share in total revenue). Thus, to unlock full potential of Epsilon, Alliance Data has decided to explore strategic alternatives. Also, following a divestiture, the company expects to intensify focus on growth and realignment for Alliance Data 2.0.Alliance Data has stated that if the divestiture materializes, the proceedings will be deployed to de-lever its balance sheet as well as return capital to shareholders via dividends and share buyback. The company aims to lower corporate leverage ratio to 2.2 or lower by 2018-end.Shares of Alliance Data have lost 23.5% year to date against the industry’s increase of 12.7%. Organic growth strength, a realigned portfolio and effective capital deployment should help the stock turn around.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked financial transaction service provider are Cardtronics plc CATM, Envestnet, Inc.

The stock lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.09%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.13%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.51%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the social media company had lost 7.34% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.28% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.92% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from FB as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be January 30, 2019. In that report, analysts expect FB to post earnings of $2.16 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.82%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $16.40 billion, up 26.4% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.36 per share and revenue of $55.33 billion. These totals would mark changes of +19.48% and +36.11%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for FB. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3.14% higher. FB currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that FB has a Forward P/E ratio of 19.11 right now. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 29.13.Investors should also note that FB has a PEG ratio of 0.85 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Internet - Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.21 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 74, putting it in the top 29% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

That means that a near-monopoly on the web may face stiff competition elsewhere.A wide-ranging sector inquiry would allow the EU to chart what’s going on, said Ioannis Kokkoris, a law professor at the Queen Mary University of London. ""Intervention is much more effective when the market is fully understood.”Outside Europe, Australia is looking at how digital platforms affect media and advertising, and in the U.S, the Federal Trade Commission held a hearing in November on the economics of online advertising.Even this year, Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg had to explain at a Senate hearing how the company makes money.

FB,12-03-2018 02:10PM,Here's My Top Stock to Buy in December,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apos-top-stock-buy-december-221800473.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) seems to have been in the news for all the wrong reasons recently. Pessimism began in July when Facebook provided a bleak outlook for a sharp deceleration in revenue growth and narrowing operating margins during the rest of 2018 and into 2019. Then, in late September, Facebook discovered hackers had stolen some access tokens, which could have been used to take over accounts. Adding fuel to the fire last month, The New York Times ran a scathing article on Facebook's leadership, which the social network was quick to note included ""a number of inaccuracies.""Once you add in a broader-market sell-off that hit tech stocks particularly hard beginning Oct. 1 and through most of November, it's no surprise that shares of Facebook have tumbled. The stock is down 34% since the company's second-quarter earnings release in July.While it may take time for sentiment in the media toward Facebook to turn positive, the stock may not stay this low for long. Opportunistic investors willing to hold the stock as the company works through its current challenges may benefit from buying shares while they're trading so much lower than they were this summer. After all, the stock's lower price has essentially already priced in the slower growth investors are expecting.Image source: Getty Images.Here are three reasons Facebook stock is a buy below $145.First off, investors shouldn't overlook Facebook's powerful network effect. About 2.3 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.5 billion use it every day. With so much of the world using Facebook, the sheer number of people on the platform is a competitive advantage in and of itself, giving the platform unprecedented scale and reach.To really drive home how well the company has connected people around the world, Facebook started sharing a new key metric in the second quarter of 2018: the number of people using at least one of its apps -- Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, or Messenger -- each month. In Q2, this number was 2.5 billion. By Q3, this figure had already risen to over 2.6 billion. ""We believe this is a better way to measure our community over time because so many people use more than one of our apps,"" said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the company's third-quarter earnings call.Even more staggering, Zuckerberg also noted in its Q3 call that over 2 billion people are now using at least one of the company's services every day.No social network has come close to rivaling Facebook's user engagement levels. And the more Facebook grows, the stronger its network effect will be.Sure, Facebook's revenue growth has decelerated rapidly recently. Third-quarter revenue was up 33% year over year -- down from 42% growth in Q2 and 49% growth in Q1. In addition, management said it expects its year-over-year revenue growth rate to decelerate by about 5 to 9 percentage points in Q4 versus Q3.But management's guidance still implies robust year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 of about 24% to 28%. Given that Facebook is still growing rapidly (albeit not as rapidly as it was in previous quarters) and that management anticipates a meaningful operating margin of around 35% over the long haul, the company's current price-to-free cash flow ratio of 23 makes Facebook stock look attractive.Finally, investors shouldn't forget how well Zuckerberg and Facebook's management team have executed at critical junctures in the company's history, ultimately leading to significant value creation for shareholders.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Image source: Facebook.For instance, when Facebook went public in 2012, the company hadn't even begun monetizing the mobile browsing experience. Yet within the next three years, mobile advertising revenue made up a whopping 73% of total advertising revenue, and the company proved that mobile ads were ultimately more important than desktop ads.In addition, Facebook management has shown incredible foresight by acquiring photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging platform WhatsApp for sums that seemed wildly expensive at the time but have proven to be bargains in retrospect. Both of these social networks have grown significantly, with Instagram and WhatsApp now boasting over 1 billion and 1.5 billion monthly active users, respectively.Some other key areas where management has executed very well are its aggressive investment in video, the quick rollout of the Stories format across its platforms, and a growing emphasis on building out its messaging services.Facebook will likely continue to face very high-profile challenges. But the company's powerful network effect and its history of strong and timely execution suggest the social network will weather these storms and continue to create value for shareholders.More From The Motley FoolDaniel Sparks has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

FB,12-03-2018 07:10AM,Is It Too Late to Buy Alphabet Stock Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-buy-alphabet-stock-now-153341495.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.If you were thinking about buying Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) during the latest downturn, I hope you pulled the trigger when it was near $1,000. Ending last week up over $1,100 and running even higher now, many investors are wondering if they’ve missed their chance to buy GOOGL stock. That depends.For long-term investors, the name of the game is having a lower cost basis. For short-term traders, it’s about having momentum working in your favor, whether long or short. We almost never buy the bottom and sell the top, but getting as close as we can always helps.After last week’s breakout, GOOGL stock certainly has momentum at its back. Shares are up almost $100 apiece over the last week and it’s off to the races. The question now is, will we get a buyable pullback in Alphabet?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFrom a technical perspective, we told investors to buy GOOGL stock on a pullback to $1,010. Alphabet fell a few bucks below that mark, giving their opportunity for entry. However, the problem is that when great entry opportunities like this come by, investors are usually too panicked to step in.That makes plenty of sense because their hard-earned money is on the line. Who wants to lose that? No one, and the hesitation is totally reasonable. But with certain companies — like Alphabet — we need to realize a few things.The first is the business. Even though we’re talking about GOOGL stock, don’t think of it as just a stock. Think of Alphabet as a company. We’re talking about an enterprise that has two of the internet’s most popular websites in the world, Google.com and YouTube.com.The internet is the highway to advertising. While Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are big players in the internet ad space, Alphabet is considered king and there’s little reason to bet against it. YouTube has numbers you would hardly believe. YouTube users stream more than 1 billion hours per day.With those two assets, I find little reason to bet against Alphabet. More so though, GOOGL stock is a leader in the driverless car revolution. Some analysts are assigning valuations of more than $150 billion for this unit. Finally, its cloud business is no joke either, helping to drive sales growth higher.The other reason? Its valuation and balance sheet. GOOGL stock trades at 25 times this year’s earnings, which is reasonable given its ~20% annual revenue run rate and double-digit percentage growth in earnings. Finally, with $106 billion in cash and ~$4 billion in debt, one could consider Alphabet a titan with respect to its balance sheet.That’s why we step in and buy GOOGL stock on deep pullbacks.Okay, okay. We get it, Google’s fundamentals are top notch. So what does the chart say for GOOGL stock?When companies with strong fundamentals go on sale, we buy them. This is particularly true as they fall into support, giving long-term investors a nice cost basis and short-term traders a solid risk/reward. For GOOGL stock, that came into play around $1,000 a share.That support level held and Alphabet stock jumped back into its falling channel (blue lines). It didn’t take long for shares to power through resistance and run from $1,060 to $1109 in just a few days. Technically, shares were able to close above the 50-day and on Monday, they are trying to close above the 200-day.If we get a strong push into year end — which statistically, is quite possible — then resistance might not play a huge role just yet. However, it’s worth keeping an eye on this $1,140 area.It’s just above the 200-day moving average and is a downtrend resistance mark dating back to July, when GOOGL stock hit its all-time highs near $1,300. Just above this area, near $1,160, is the 100-day moving average. If Alphabet can clear this area, it’s all-time highs are on the table. If not though, it will need time to set back up as a long candidate.Investors can buy on a pullback-and-hold of the 50-day, while more aggressive investors can buy if GOOGL can clear-and-hold $1,130.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long GOOGL and AMZN.Compare BrokersThe post Is It Too Late to Buy Alphabet Stock Now? appeared first on InvestorPlace."

The episode then dives into the world of sportswear and sneakers after another historic apparel firm jumped back into the business of basketball.The American Gaming Association estimates that more than $150 billion is bet on sports illegally every year in the U.S. This means we could soon see more than the eight states that currently offer legalized sports gambling enter the market.The likes of FanDuel, which is owned by Paddy Power BetFair PDYPY, Caesars CZR, MGM, William Hill WIMHY, and others have all jumped into the online sports betting industry in New Jersey. Going forward, live in-gaming betting looks poised to drive the sports betting market in our mobile age. This is part of the reason why MLB became the third major North American professional sports league to partner with MGM.""Our research is really strong on the idea that sports gaming is an important source of fan engagement and we operate in a competitive environment and we have to take advantage of every opportunity to drive engagement by our fans,"" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a release.Going forward, it will be interesting to see if companies like Facebook FB, Twitter TWTR, or Google GOOGL possibly enter the sports betting business because of their massive user bases and infrastructure. Maybe more likely, however, would be an influx of young tech-focused sports betting startups that try to shake up the traditional gaming giants’ current control over the market.Meanwhile, privately-owned New Balance is ready to jump back into the basketball shoe market after the sportswear firm reportedly signed NBA star Kawhi Leonard last week. The move follows Puma’s splash announcement to get back into the NBA this summer after nearly 20 years away from the sport. New Balance and Puma will try to grab some market share from Nike NKE, Adidas ADDYY, and third-place Under Armour UAA.With that said, performance shoe sales have slipped, and the current sportswear market seems to favor athleisure firms such as Lululemon LULU. Yet, these companies might try to capitalize on the current retro trend, which could actually favor Nike and Adidas.As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is GoDaddy Inc. GDDY, which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in GDDY.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 12 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 53 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 34 cents.Also, for the current quarter, GoDaddy has seen 11 downward estimate revisions versus one revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 13 cents a share from 22 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 9.7% in the past month.GoDaddy Inc.

MA,12-03-2018 10:11AM,3 Financial Stocks to Buy While They’re Cheap,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-financial-stocks-buy-while-183609499.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.This morning stocks are rallying on the back of good news from the G20 meetings. China and the U.S. struck a deal to halt the tariff rhetoric so that they can negotiate a long-term trade deal between the two countries.The fear that the U.S. and China would bog down global growth with tariffs has driven a lot of market volatility this year. There is a lot on the line for all economies and this morning’s news is a relief to the markets.Year-to-date — while not a financial disaster — equities have been under pressure and in see saw from one headline to the other. This is especially disappointing to financial stocks. This year was supposed to be when bank stocks flourished. The U.S. Fed is in a rate hike cycle and the idea was that banks would profit from the higher rates. This hasn’t worked out that way so far. In fact, coming into today the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLF) is down 3% in 2019, lagging behind the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq which are up 4% and 11% respectively.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs a result, bank stocks are now even cheaper, so there is value in most of them, and they should be part of a healthy portfolio.  At some point this general macroeconomic malaise will pass and the sentiment selling will abate. There is a lot to like in these financial stocks and they are worth accumulating.Source: ShutterstockFirst on my list of financial stocks is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). BAC sells at a trailing P/E of 13.6 — a ratio which is cheap in both absolute and relative terms. At these levels, BAC stock sells at almost price-to-book, meaning that investors give it no credit beyond the assets on its books.Buying BAC here is likely very safe. Bank of America has a strong management team. They were able to navigate out of the worst financial disaster and save a few other banks along the way. In short, if the stock markets move higher in the next few years, then BAC stock will too. In addition, it mainly operates in the U.S. so it has little exposure to China headlines.Source: Via SquareMomentum stocks rarely give investors clear entry points. That is the case with Square (NYSE:SQ). Unlike Bank of America stock, SQ stock is far from cheap. But this is a fintech stock so I don’t give the same amount weight to value as I would for a standard financial center. Case in point, even though SQ has fallen 20% in the last three months, it’s still up 80% in 12 months.This is a stock that should to be part of a complete portfolio. SQ has solid fundamentals as it begins to compete with the likes of Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Recently SQ stock was dragged lower by the bitcoin crash. Part of the rise of Square was tied to its foray into the blockchain arena. So like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), SQ suffers on the way down with bitcoin too.Both BAC and SQ are financial stocks technically poised for spikes. They are now re-approaching pivot zones and if the bulls can prevail in retaking them they can shot 7% higher on momentum alone. Since SQ is a fast mover, its breakout will be faster and longer than that of BAC, but they should both do well.Source: ShutterstockLast on my list of financial stocks to buy today is Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) . GS stock has grossly under-performed in absolute terms  and relative to the sector. GS is down 24% in 12 months.Recently Goldman Sachs has been in the news over issues with their potential involvement in the Malaysian bond fraud event. I don’t now how this scenario is going to play out but it’s worth a small bet for a positive resolution. Usually Wall Street is too quick to overreact and it’s too early to call GS stock dead for good. As a result of its massive fall, GS now sells at an 8x forward P/E.Nevertheless, Goldman Sachs stock still carries a high ticket price at $190 per share. So one can use options to speculate on a rebound into the first quarter of 2019 instead of risking the face value of the stock. Options offer lower entry costs for a chance to profit on a rebound. In addition to the fundamental news, GS stock is also at a technical disadvantage. Losing the $220 level triggered a bearish pattern that may still be unfolding. There is further risk below if $185 zone also fails.Click here for more of my market thesis and get an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

MA,11-29-2018 06:11PM,"Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled Settle With SEC for Hyping ICOs",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/floyd-mayweather-dj-khaled-settle-215400471.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.(Bloomberg) -- Boxer Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled were accused of failing to disclose payments they received for hyping initial coin offerings, making them the biggest names sanctioned in U.S. regulators’ months long crackdown on digital-token misconduct.Mayweather, one of the his sport’s most recognizable personalities, agreed to pay more than $600,000 to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency said in a Thursday statement. Khaled will pay more than $150,000. Both were accused of violating securities laws by touting ICOs on social media without disclosing the coins’ backers had paid them to promote the tokens.Celebrity endorsements of ICOs -- in which companies raise money by selling digital tokens instead of shares -- became increasingly common as Bitcoin surged to a record high late last year. All the hype prompted the SEC to warn last November that pitches could be unlawful if famous backers’ compensation wasn’t disclosed. The Mayweather and Khaled cases are the first SEC punishments against individuals over the illicit touting of ICOs.""These cases highlight the importance of full disclosure to investors,"" Stephanie Avakian, the SEC’s co-enforcement director, said in the statement. “With no disclosure about the payments, Mayweather and Khaled’s ICO promotions may have appeared to be unbiased, rather than paid endorsements.”Neither Mayweather nor Khaled admitted or denied the SEC’s allegations. Lawyers for the men didn’t immediately return phone calls seeking comment.A company involved in both enforcement actions is Centra Tech Inc., which claimed it planned to create a virtual-currency debit card. In April, U.S. authorities arrested Centra Tech’s founders, and the SEC accused the company of illegally raising more than $25 million through an ICO by falsely claiming that it had entered into partnerships with Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc.In September 2017, Mayweather posted a picture of himself holding his boxing title belts on his Twitter account with the caption: “Centra’s (CTR) ICO starts in a few hours. Get your before they sell out, I got mine...""Also in September 2017, Khaled hyped “the Centra Card"" and “Centra Wallet” through his Instagram and Twitter accounts.Neither Mayweather nor Khaled mentioned that Centra Tech was paying them, the SEC said.The SEC’s repeated warnings that ICOs are susceptible to fraud hasn’t stopped the industry from raising billions of dollars. The SEC has said it considers the vast majority of the offerings to be securities, which must be registered the regulator to be lawful. Earlier this month, the SEC imposed its first fines against companies for failing to register coin offerings.(Adds details on case starting in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ben Bain in Washington at bbain2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Gregory MottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P."
MA,11-29-2018 06:11PM,The 7 Best ETFs to Avoid the Tech Bloodbath,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-etfs-avoid-tech-170807305.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Are you wondering what the best ETFs to buy are given all the market volatility we’ve been facing in recent weeks?The tech sector has been hit especially hard: The Technology Select Sector Index is down 11.5% over the past three months —  almost double the loss of the S&P 500. But most of the largest companies — and biggest growth companies — in the market are tech stocks. So what should investors do?They should try to buy the whole market. According to the Index Industry Association, the trade group for the index industry, there were 3.7 million published indices globally as of June 30, 2018, 13% higher than a year earlier. Many of those indices are tracked by ETFs. They cover virtually every subject imaginable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt’s both incredibly easy and difficult for regular investors to capture vast swaths of the global economy. Easy because with the click of a button you can own some of China’s biggest companies; difficult because the choices available have become far too great for anyone with a day job.Don’t despair.Here are the best ETFs to buy for exposure to tech while avoiding some, if not all, of the bloodbath.Source: Dave Center via Flickr (Modified)If you’re an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fan, the SPDR Portfolio Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA:SPTM) is the best ETF for you. SPTM has the iPhone maker as its number one holding with a weighting of 3.25% as of November 26.The ETF, which charges just 0.03%, tracks the SSGA Total Stock Market Index, which captures 98% of the investable U.S. equity market.There are currently 2,659 holdings in SPTM. The weighted average market cap of those holdings is $171.4 billion.As for tech stocks — if you include the newly created communication services sector — they account for 27.9% of the ETF’s overall portfolio. If you exclude communication services, which also consists of some media stocks, the weighting is a more palatable 20.9%.A popular ETF with $2.5 billion in net assets, it was launched on October 4, 2000. Since inception, SPTM has delivered an annualized return of 5.92% through October 31.Source: ShutterstockIf Warren Buffett were recommending an ETF to buy, it would surely be the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO), the ETF version of the mutual fund he often suggests when asked what regular investors should buy.VOO is Vanguard’s version of the S&P 500, probably the world’s best-known stock index. Charging just 0.04% annually, VOO gives you 509 of America’s finest companies including Apple. The top ten holdings account for 23% of the ETFs $99.4 billion in total assets.Like SPTM, VOO has a reasonably large exposure to tech, accounting for 30.8% overall if you include communication services.But VOO’s performed significantly better than SPTM — up 14.1% on an annualized basis through October 31 — because it didn’t get its start until September 7, 2010, almost ten full years later, when equities were on the rise.You can’t go wrong listening to Warren Buffett; VOO is one of the best ETFs to buy now.Source: ShutterstockWhen you think about tech investing, growth stocks generally come to mind.The iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWY) is one of the best ETFs to buy for growth. As the name implies, IWY has a significant portion of its $1.2 billion in net assets invested in tech and communication services stocks.So, if you’re trying to avoid tech stocks, IWY probably isn’t the best ETF to own.However, if you’re willing to look past the 32.6% weighting in technology and 12.2% weighting in communication services, it’s a decent investment.Well, even though IWY holds a large number of tech stocks, some of those tech names, especially in the top ten holdings, use technology to complement their businesses rather than to make them.Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) are two prime examples of companies that use technology to provide financial services. Most people would view them more as consumer brands and less as technology innovators.Don’t tell the CEOs of Mastercard and Visa, but you get where I’m coming from.Oh, and it only charges 0.20% for exposure to stocks that are expected to grow earnings faster than large caps as a whole.Source: ShutterstockThe Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (NYSEARCA:XLG) tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Top 50 Index, which is the 50 largest market caps in the S&P 500, weighted using a float-adjusted market cap.Naturally, XLG also has a significant component of tech stocks, but they’re huge companies with an average market cap of $391 billion; they aren’t going out of business unless the world as we know it ends.Together, tech and communication services stocks, account for 43.7% of the ETF’s $762 million in net assets. The top ten holdings have a 42.1% weighting with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) knocking Apple — it’s the second-largest holding — out of the top spot for a change.As of September 30, an investment of $10,000 a decade ago in XLG, is today worth $29,288 after its annual fee of 0.20%. Clearly this is one of the best ETFs around.Source: ShutterstockYou might not have noticed, but I’ve limited my best ETF picks to one per provider so that you get a diversified group of products and not just Vanguard or iShares’ best options.The Fidelity NASDAQ Composite Index Tracking Stock (NASDAQ:ONEQ) has been around for more than 15 years. It’s intended to track the performance of the Nasdaq Composite Index although the ETF has just 999 holdings compared to the more than 3,000 stocks trading on Nasdaq.The ETFs top ten holdings account for 45.4% of the portfolio.So, why did I pick ONEQ when technology and communication services account for 45.8% of its $1.8 billion in net assets?One word: Performance.Over the past ten years, ONEQ achieved an annual total return of 16.7% through October 31, easily one of the best-performing ETFs of the past decade.Long term, the 0.21% expense ratio is worth it.Source: ShutterstockThe WisdomTree US Total Earnings ETF (NYSEARCA:EXT) has just $88.6 million in net assets making it the smallest of the ETFs on my list. That said, EXT has some interesting characteristics worth considering.For example, EXT tracks the WisdomTree U.S. Earnings Index, which uses fundamental earnings to weight the holdings. Companies included in the index have generated positive earnings over four consecutive quarters at the time of the index’s annual rebalancing in December.The weighting of each stock is based on the sum of the four consecutive quarters of earnings divided by the total earnings of the entire portfolio. The higher they are, the higher the weighting.No individual holding can represent more than 20% of the entire index. No sector — and this one’s important vis-à-vis technology — will be weighted at more than 25%.As of September 30, technology accounted for 23.3% of the ETF’s portfolio. Although tech is the sector with the highest weighting, it’s still much lower than some of the other ETFs mentioned in this article.Charging 0.28%, I think it’s a reasonable price to pay for one of the best ETFs to buy now: a diversified portfolio of profitable U.S. stocks with limited tech exposure.Source: ShutterstockAlthough JPMorgan is the second-smallest of the ETF providers in this article with $17.7 billion in assets under management as of November 26, it’s got some interesting ETFs.JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF (NYSEARCA:JQUA) is one of them. Who wouldn’t want “quality” to be a part of an ETF investment strategy?The day someone launches a fund with the word “crappy” in the title is the day we know there are no more good ETF investing ideas.Seriously, JQUA tracks the JP Morgan US Quality Factor Index, that takes the sector weightings of the Russell 1000 — the largest 1,000 investable U.S. companies — and then quantifies each of the companies in the Russell 1000 based on profitability, quality of earnings, and solvency.Currently, JQUA has $36.7 million in net assets, spread among 230 holdings. Technology stocks account for just 20.0% of the ETF portfolio, making it one of the best ETFs to buy a large selection of stocks while limiting your tech exposure.The top ten holdings account for just 18.4% of the portfolio and Apple isn’t anywhere near the top. It’s in 8th spot (hey that’s low for AAPL!) behind Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and ahead of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Merck (NYSE:MRK).More importantly, it charges just 0.12% annually, a reasonable price for a reasonable ETF.As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare BrokersThe post The 7 Best ETFs to Avoid the Tech Bloodbath appeared first on InvestorPlace."

In fact, in just the past five years, consumer debt has gone up by $1 trillion.Taking a closer look at the breakdown for borrowers: $1.04 trillion is revolving or credit card debt, which has jumped 22% since 2013, and $2.9 trillion in non-revolving debt, which includes student and auto loans, jumping 30% in the past five years. (Mortgage debt is not included in this number.)Related: 5 ways to get your credit score out of the dumpsBased on the rate of holiday spending reported in these past few weeks alone, LendingTree analysts expect credit card balances to grow by at least 5% for the remainder of 2018.Already this year, Americans have shelled out over $100 billion in credit card interest and fees. Adding fuel to the fire are all-time high interest rates with APR’s averaging 16% to 17%. And borrowing will only get more expensive as there will likely be three to four more interest rate hikes by the end of 2019.Consumers struggling with their debt payments can take advantage of cost-effective debt solution experts from free credit counseling services at non-profits like Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS) for credit card debt, as well as Student Debt Crisis for help with repayment options when handling their student loans.Jeanie Ahn is a senior reporter and producer at Yahoo Finance, covering personal finance and women in business.

MA,11-29-2018 06:11PM,MasterCard (MA) Up 2.3% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-ma-2-3-since-143102802.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.A month has gone by since the last earnings report for MasterCard (MA). Shares have added about 2.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MasterCard due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Mastercard Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates on Volume GrowthMastercard Incorporated reported adjusted earnings of $1.78 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.95%. Earnings improved 33% year over year. Improved revenues drove the earnings upside.Better-than-expected results were primarily backed by higher switched transactions, increase in cross-border volume and gross dollar volume as well as gains from acquisitions. An increase in rebates and incentives year over year was a partial dampener.Strong Operational PerformanceMastercard’s revenues of $3.9 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%. Revenues were up 17% year over year (on a currency neutral basis).Total adjusted operating expenses increased 10% to $1.6 billion, due to higher, general and administrative expenses, advertising and marketing expenses and investment made for growth.Interest expenses of $48 million increased 37% year over year.Operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 59.4%.Gross dollar volume increased 13% while purchase volume was up 15%.The company’s margins gained from a lower tax rate of 16.1% in the third quarter that compares with 26% in the year-ago quarter.As of Sep 30, 2018, the company’s customers had issued 2.5 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, adjusted for the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation.Financial UpdateAs of Sep 30, 2018, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $6.87 billion, up 15.8% from the level at year-end 2017. Long-term debt was $5.86 billion, up 7.4% from the mark at 2017 end.Share Repurchase and Dividend PaymentDuring the reported quarter, Mastercard repurchased shares worth $1.2 billion and returned $260 million in dividends.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresCurrently, MasterCard has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, MasterCard has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MA,11-29-2018 06:11PM,Is Mastercard (MA) Stock Outpacing Its Business Services Peers This Year?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-ma-stock-outpacing-business-143002223.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Investors focused on the Business Services space have likely heard of Mastercard (MA), but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Business Services sector should help us answer this question.Mastercard is one of 197 individual stocks in the Business Services sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #2 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. MA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MA's full-year earnings has moved 0.45% higher within the past quarter. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.Our latest available data shows that MA has returned about 33.64% since the start of the calendar year. Meanwhile, the Business Services sector has returned an average of 11.18% on a year-to-date basis. This shows that Mastercard is outperforming its peers so far this year.To break things down more, MA belongs to the Financial Transaction Services industry, a group that includes 25 individual companies and currently sits at #26 in the Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks in this group have gained about 18.18% so far this year, so MA is performing better this group in terms of year-to-date returns.Going forward, investors interested in Business Services stocks should continue to pay close attention to MA as it looks to continue its solid performance.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MA,11-28-2018 06:11PM,3 Great Stocks for Low-Risk Investors,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-great-stocks-low-risk-131500145.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Stocks might be among the riskiest investments, but the risk factor is also why stocks have historically earned greater investor returns than bonds. Moreover, it's important to understand that the degree of risk varies with every company, which means the stock market has plenty to offer for low-risk investors.Think about companies with economic moats, an eye on the future, and strong balance sheets to help them tide over challenges while they grow. I believe NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI), and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) are three solid contenders that should suit a low-risk investor's palate. Here's why.The resilient nature of demand for essentials like electricity, gas, and water makes utilities typical low-risk stocks. But looking into the future, you'd be better off owning a utility that doesn't just supply electricity and gas but uses clean sources of energy to do so.NextEra Energy is one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., as well as the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy, with nearly 47,000 megawatts (MW) of total operating power-generation capacity. NextEra's growth plans and dividend growth, in particular, make for a compelling investment thesis.Image source: Getty Images.Between 2017 and 2020, NextEra plans to invest $17.5 billion to $19 billion on new capacity and modernization of its power infrastructure. On the renewables side, the company expects to pump anything between $22 billion and $25 billion into expanding its renewables pipeline, from roughly 28,000 MW now to 40,000 MW by 2020.These investments should ensure NextEra continues to generate great shareholder value, as it has in the past. Its adjusted earnings per share and dividend have grown at compound annual rates of 8.1% and 8.9%, respectively, since 2005, which is an incredible record for any utility. Investors could be in for even bigger returns, with management targeting dividend growth of 12% to 14% annually through ""at least"" 2020. Top it up with NextEra Energy's 2.5% dividend yield, and you have the perfect recipe for a long-term winner.If NextEra Energy is a typically defensive stock, Canadian National Railway is on the other side of the spectrum -- it's a cyclical stock. Why, then, am I recommending CN to risk-averse investors? Because railroads are the preferred mode of transporting goods for the long haul, and CN is a leader in its own right with the most expansive rail network in North America, connecting three coasts.In fact, that's just one of the reasons that you might want to own CN. End-market conditions haven't been all that great in the past ten years, but CN has been a nimble company, swiftly picking up the pieces thanks to cost efficiency and prudent management. 2018 has been a great example of this so far. Earlier this year, CN didn't just oust its then-CEO, but also invested record capital into infrastructure ahead of plans to remove unexpected operational bottlenecks. You rarely get to witness such agility among companies.CNI data by YCharts.To be sure, you have to have patience as a CN investor, as cyclicality can make the stock volatile. Nonetheless, because transportation is a leading indicator of economic recovery, CN is also among the first stocks to bounce back from a trough. The company is also the most cost-efficient railroad in the U.S., has consistently generated positive free cash flow even in challenging years, and has increased its dividend every year since 1996. With its new CEO already displaying competence, shareholders' investment in CN should be in good hands.In pretty much every sector, there's at least one disruptive trend taking shape. In financials, digital payments is one of these. While Mastercard's payments processing network is already supporting digital transactions in more than 210 countries, cash is still predominant in major parts of the world. If that should open up opportunities to expand the reach of its co-branded debit, credit, and prepaid cards as e-commerce takes off, mobile payments could be the next big thing for Mastercard.Image source: Getty Images.Mastercard earns a fee every time its cards are swiped in any part of the world, and as more and more cards get into circulation, the value of Mastercard's business rises. It's a high-margin business with strong growth catalysts. Lately, Mastercard has also been focusing on services such as security, fraud prevention, and data analytics, to build upon its customer base and add a layer of diversification to its portfolio. And with mobile wallets picking up steam, Mastercard is teaming up with more and more merchants to tap this emerging cashless-payments trend.Given its strong global foothold in a growing industry, a rock-solid balance sheet, and management committed to generating operating margin north of 50%, there's little reason to believe Mastercard shares won't continue to command a premium. I'd even say Mastercard is one of the few growth stocks with potential rewards far outweighing the risks.More From The Motley FoolNeha Chamaria has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

NFLX,12-03-2018 06:11AM,Trump’s G20 bromance with Xi means one thing: an epic Santa Claus rally for stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-g20-bromance-xi-means-one-thing-epic-santa-claus-rally-stocks-142002188.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.It’s time to charge that extra $5,000 holiday gift because the year-end for stocks could be pretty sweet.And you can thank President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping for the inevitable rip-roaring rally into 2019.Well, that and investor foe turned short-termed bestie, Fed Chair Jerome Powell.What happened: Trump and his Chinese counterpart agreed at this weekend’s G20 to delay higher tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods from China; the increase, from 10% to 25% was set to hit Jan. 1. The decision will be a 90-day ceasefire. China will purchase a “very substantial” amount of agricultural, industrial and electronics products, according to the U.S. side.Trump followed what amounts to a weekend win for U.S. businesses with a late night tweet Sunday that China would reduce and remove tariffs on imported autos. The rate currently stands at a penalizing 40%.In July, China lowered tariffs on U.S. cars to 15% from 25%. But it then quickly reversed course and enacted a 25% additional retaliatory tariff in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese products.A White House spokesperson didn’t immediately return a request for clarification on Trump’s tweet.Markets around the globe spiked on Monday in response to the cooling of a modern day cold war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 287 points. German automakers BMW and Daimler popped 7.3% and 7.5%, respectively, as the reduction of tariffs could unleash better sales in China.Why it matters: Stocks have had a rough go since hitting record highs in early October. But concerns over an unfriendly Federal Reserve and profit-margin-killing tariffs — the key factors in the blow-off from the October highs — have reversed rather quickly. That’s positive news for the markets.For one, Powell’s speech at the Economic Club last week suggested he will not move very quickly hiking rates in 2019. Powell realizes that he could tip the U.S. economy into recession if not careful.Investors could now sleep easier on this front, for a little while at least. With the perception of the Fed being a touch more accommodative, investors are apt to wade back into beaten-up, above-normal risk assets. See battered tech stocks such as Apple, Netflix and Amazon.Meanwhile, Trump’s ceasefire on his trade war with China removes a significant black cloud hanging over the heads of investors. Companies of all kinds for months have warned on the impact of having to raise prices to offset tariffs. Walmart’s chief financial officer Brett Biggs, for instance, told Yahoo Finance in November the retailer would be forced to raise prices on shoppers if the higher tariff went into effect in January. Walmart, like many retailers, source a good percentage of their merchandise from China.Other companies have spent most of 2018 figuring out how to diversify their supply chains away from China. That has come at monetary and human capital costs, with more on the way if the trade war continues.At the same time, with the plunge in soybean prices thanks to China’s retaliatory efforts, America’s heartland has been slammed. Farm bankruptcies are on the rise as farmers are unable to find buyers for their crops.Blake Hurst, the president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, told Yahoo Finance that his fellow farmers will unlikely be buying expensive equipment in the next year. Hurst says farmers are just trying to survive the year, let alone find ways to justify spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on new equipment.But with China’s new commitment to buying U.S. agricultural products, the outlook for farmers is arguably vastly better than it was one week ago. That has implications not only for farmers, but for companies like railroads that assist in shipping their products.Wall Street has used this uncertain backdrop to lower their profit forecasts for S&P 500 companies in recent months. They may revisit those lowered estimates, and in doing so help prop up the markets.Bottom line: Wall Street is doing its darnedest to poo-poo the weekend’s events at the G20. Unsurprising as many strategists were caught on the wrong side of the trade into the unpredictable gathering.“Another reason to wait before cheering the end of the trade war is that 90 days to work out a broad agreement is very short. Especially because the agreement should also encompass a deal on more sensitive issues like the theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfers in joint ventures. Most wide-ranging bilateral trade agreements take years to negotiate,” says ING strategist Raoul Leering.Says Goldman Sachs strategist Alec Phillips: “While the Xi-Trump dinner has clearly improved the tone of the U.S.-China relationship for the time being, and we would expect an initial positive market reaction, the “pause” prolongs the period of uncertainty around the eventual structure of trade relations between the two countries.”Perhaps.Common sense says though the trio of Trump, Powell and Xi have set the groundwork for a healthy rally into year end. Uncertainty has been removed and stocks are well off their highs, a recipe for investors to go bargain hunting. Whether that leads to a stock market melt-up like we saw in January of this year is unknown. Either way, the Santa Clause rally is poised to kick into overdrive and bring with it a lot of good cheer to trading accounts.__Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.

Unlike the usual Netflix content deals, streaming exclusivity for “Friends” isn’t guaranteed for the length deal.  The unusual structure is a sign of the complexities AT&T will have to navigate as it tries to build its own streaming platform without alienating companies such as Netflix, which spend heavily on acquired product."
NFLX,12-03-2018 01:11PM,"5 Top Stock Trades for Tuesday: NFLX, AMD, SQ, QQQ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stock-trades-tuesday-205054746.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Investors had a sigh of relief as the U.S. and China made some progress on the trade front. While it didn’t put an end to the dispute and there’s plenty of negotiating left to do, it signaled that, at least for the immediate future, the trade war won’t escalate. That allowed markets to rally and gave us a whole new set of top stock trades to watch.Before we get too far, let’s zoom out and look more broadly. Specifically, let’s look at the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), which fell more than 16% from peak to trough. That’s a rather notable decline for an ETF such as this.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn any regard, we have shares rallying through the $173 mark and pulling back. That’s significant, as Monday’s move in the QQQ initially put it through the 50-day and the 200-day moving average. It’s been a quick — and doubted — 9.5% rally off the lows. It’s making many investors hesitant to chase as well.From here I want one of two things for the bulls: Either pullback or consolidate in this area and hold the $170 level or rally again over the next few days and then stay above the 50-day/200-day area.The markets already seem a little tired on Monday, so if we get some profit-taking over the next few days, I want to see $170 hold. If it doesn’t, $166 is on deck.Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was uninspiring on Monday, hitting almost $300 per share before falling flat and landing at $285. Ugh. This one has been a defeating one for the bulls.The move isn’t too surprising, given that NFLX failed right at downtrend resistance. As long as it as stays above $270 though, the bulls might be all right.If it does, it will secure a “higher low” and give NFLX more energy to push through that resistance mark. The key to watch is which level gives way first. If it’s $270, the November lows are back in play.Up almost 30% from the lows, many investors are wondering if they missed the train on Square (NYSE:SQ).Like NFLX, shares are running right into downtrend resistance. Bulls can buy a dip down the $68 to $70 level and use a close below $65 as their stop-loss. There’s decent support nearby to warrant a long position for aggressive investors, but below support and things could get ugly.This one is putting money in bulls’ pocket, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares rallying almost 11% on Monday. A week ago, we flagged this trade, and noted several times afterwards that the risk/reward remained appealing.That’s as AMD consolidated above prior downtrend resistance (purple line). As shares now run into the 50-day moving average and $24 level, those who bought may consider booking some or all profits.For those that are letting it ride, I wouldn’t let shares get below $23.Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is moving strong off the lows, but has been weak all year. I own a morsel of the stock for its low valuation and solid growth, but other than that, Celgene has been painful ride.Coming into this $77-ish level, we’ll find out which group — the bulls or the bears — will harness control. This level was support for several months in early summer, but turned to resistance in November. Just above this mark is the 50-day moving average as well. Should Celgene fall — which wouldn’t be a surprise — look to see that the 21-day moving average holds as support. If it doesn’t, the lows are back in play.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

NFLX,12-03-2018 09:11AM,ROKU Stock Is a Classic Example of Why Profits Matter,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-stock-classic-example-why-164114019.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.ROKU (NASDAQ:ROKU) is one of those stocks I’ve stood behind in 2018 despite the fact the company doesn’t make any money. As a result, my pride’s been battered and bruised as ROKU stock has taken a beating. It’s down 47% through November 30 after reaching an all-time high October 1 of $77.57.Here’s what I said about Roku stock in March:“As a rule, I’m not a fan of investing in money-losing stocks, but at least Roku has all the makings of a profitable business five years from now,” I wrote December 6, 2016.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips“Sometimes rules are meant to be broken. In the case of ROKU stock, I was willing to make an exception. Since then it’s ridden higher into the $50s, only to come crashing back to the low $40s where it was in early December when I defended its stock price.”I finished my March 2 article suggesting investor fears of ROKU stock crashing as a result of the lock-up expiry were unfounded. Roku’s story was very much intact and it was a buy with cash in reserve in case it dropped further.It fell to a 52-week low of $29 in early April only to jump by 167% over the next six months.The company’s Q3 2018 results were good, but not good enough for investors, knocking ROKU stock for a 22% loss November 8 — its worst one-day loss since its September 2017 IPO.Interestingly, while ROKU beat on the top and bottom line, it missed analyst expectations for average revenue per user (ARPU) by a dime — analysts were expecting $17.44 — signaling a potential slowdown in its streaming advertising.My argument for owning ROKU stock was simple.As long as the company kept growing its active accounts and viewing hours of those active accounts, advertising revenue would continue to grow.In Q3 2018, Roku grew its active accounts by 43% year-over-year and 8.2% on a sequential basis to 23.8 million. The company increased streaming hours 63% YoY and 12.7% sequentially to 6.2 billion. So, the average hours streamed per account in Q3 2018 was 260.5, 4.2% higher than in Q2 2018, and 14.5% higher than Q3 2017.That’s good, no?Again, it all goes back to the analysts. They were expecting platform revenue (advertising) of $103.2 million; Roku came in $3.1 million below the estimate. That’s hardly worth a 22% single-day decline, but when you’re not making money, anything’s possible from investors given increased market volatility.I will say this: ARPU in the third quarter increased by 4.5% on a sequential basis to $17.34, its smallest increase in the past four quarters. That’s at least worth watching in the coming quarters.I still believe that Roku will go on to be a very profitable company, much like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).The advertising dollars Roku generates will increase exponentially once advertisers genuinely buy into streaming ads. Roku CEO Anthony Wood said this on CNBC:“If you’re an advertiser, you’re seeing your viewers shift from traditional linear TV to streaming…. When viewers moved to mobile, the ad dollars took a few years to catch up. But they will catch up.”In fiscal 2018, Roku expects revenues of at least $722 million, a net loss of $13-$20 million, and positive EBITDA of at least $21 million. That last number is significant because it represents a third consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA and EBITDA growth, a sign that GAAP profits are imminent.In hindsight, it’s easy to critique my recommendation of Roku stock, pointing to the fact that it wasn’t making money as a prime reason I shouldn’t have been so gung-ho about the company or its stock. However, if Roku’s assertion that all TV will be streamed and so too will TV advertising, a prediction I tend to agree with, the future price of its stock will be much higher than $77.57.But first Roku has to make a fiscal profit. When it does that, the sky’s the limit.As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare BrokersThe post ROKU Stock Is a Classic Example of Why Profits Matter appeared first on InvestorPlace."

NFLX,12-03-2018 10:11AM,Why It Makes More Sense to Invest in Microsoft Than Apple,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-makes-more-sense-invest-201623052.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Microsoft (MSFT) passed Apple as the world’s most valuable company on Friday, Nov. 30, only to appear poised to give that spot back after Monday’s market bounce lifted Apple further than the software company.Read about Apple’s path to the $1 trillion milestone.In today’s tech-obsessed markets, the idea that Apple — which famously became the world’s first $1 trillion company earlier this year — might be challenged for supremacy, let alone challenged by a company that’s not Amazon or Google, seems curious. However, there are a few things to keep in mind.The first is that Apple is no longer in possession of that coveted fourth comma. The recent market swoon has knocked its valuation down to about $860 billion. And although that swoon knocked a big chunk off of the market cap for each of the FAANG stocks — for October and November, Apple (AAPL) is down 20.6 percent, Facebook (FB) 14.5 percent, Amazon (AMZN) 15.6 percent, Netflix (NFLX) 23.5 percent and Alphabet (GOOGL) 8.1 percent — Microsoft’s losses have been considerably lower at about 2.6 percent.The other important factor to keep in mind is that although Microsoft might not be on the radar of as many consumers, its value in providing tech and computing services to corporate clients is considerable. From competing with Amazon to provide cloud-computing services to a variety of other technologies and tech services, Microsoft has built a steady business around its core products that — although without the sizzle that other major tech stocks come with — is built on a firm foundation.That could be part of why the recent market downturn largely spared the tech giant. Whereas other tech firms are built on leverage their explosive growth into huge stock prices, Microsoft has been building at a measured, sustainable place.Or, as Bloomberg writer Shira Ovide puts it: “Microsoft is the tortoise in a technology world obsessed with hares.”Microsoft vs. IBM: Can a $34B Acquisition Help IBM Return to Glory?That leaves the compelling question of whether or not investors are right to see Microsoft as being the better investment than Apple — though it might spark flashbacks to the 1990s for some.There’s no way of knowing for sure; both stocks have compelling reasons to invest. Microsoft can boast the slightly larger dividend yield, and Apple has recently been hit by concerns about the health of its iPhone sales.However, value investors might view all of this as missing the forest for the trees. After all, Apple continues to make more money than Microsoft — a lot more. Apple’s FY 2018 revenue figure is more than double that of Microsoft — $265.6 billion to Microsoft’s $110.4 billion — and its net income is nearly four times larger. With market caps that are so close, that translates to much better value numbers for Apple in a PE ratio of 15.08 to Microsoft’s 45.44. That’s in addition to Apple boasting much better profit margins and return on equity.So, only time will tell which makes the better investment, but there are reasons that it could be an overstep to bunch in Apple with other overvalued tech giants.Click through to find out what $1,000 in stocks invested 10 years ago would be worth today.More on Investing and StocksWe make money easy.

NFLX,12-03-2018 04:11AM,"3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Intel, HP and Prologis",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-big-stock-charts-monday-114817224.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.It was touch and go for the better part of Friday’s trading action, with another drubbing for General Electric (NYSE:GE) leaving doubt in investors’ minds, while an unexpectedly solid 2.2% advance from AT&T (NYSE:T) hinted that the tide could be rising for all stocks.GE shares fell 5.5% after Deutsche Bank analyst Nicole DeBlase cut her target price on the stock, while AT&T’s debt picture improved at the same time the company better explained its plans to take on streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). As the closing bell approached for the day and the week, traders increasingly decided the glass was half full. The S&P 500 ended Friday’s action at 2760.16, up 0.82% for the day, and higher by 4.8% for the week.Though work remains to be done and there are still some risks, a bullish foundation is being laid. As such, it’s not terribly surprising that plenty of stocks on Monday are hinting at bullish moves. Not all, however. Here’s what to note in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Prologis (NYSE:PLD).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPrologis is a name that has been off and on of our radar since September. For a brief moment two months ago it looked like it was going to punch through a major technical ceiling, but instead in October it peeled back to previous floor.Now it’s back to within striking distance of the ceiling again, and though it has fooled us before, this time around could lead to a different result.Click to Enlarge • The resistance line in question is right around $68, plotted with a yellow dashed line.• Zooming out to the weekly chart puts the past several months in perspective. While Prologis is never not a volatile stock, this sort of stagnation is unusual. PLD may be overdue for some more prolonged action after this consolidation period.• What’s different about this time around is support at a trio of key moving average lines.For the better part of this year, Intel shares have been fighting a battle against fears that rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) was going to crush it. Now that the dust is settling and the buzz is dying down, however, the market’s not nearly as sure the iconic company is as dead in the water as had been suggested.Still, it took an encounter with an established technical floor to bring INTC stock back to within striking distance of what could be a catalytic bullish move.Click to Enlarge • The catalyst was a hard crash with the early 2018 lows of $42.30, plotted with a red dashed line, to spark the bounce that’s currently underway. Since them, Intel shares have raced back to what’s become a cap at $49.30. That ceiling is plotted with a light blue dashed line.• On the weekly chart, we see two clear buy signals. One of them is the Chaikin line’s cross back above the zero level a few weeks back, telling us there’s good volume behind the current effort. We also just saw a bullish MACD cross.• The last potential technical ceiling is the $200-day moving average line, plotted with a solid white line, at $49.85.Finally, though HP shares had been taking blows for the better part of this year, it was holding up rather well. Either the 200-day moving average line was serving as a floor, or a technical floor that started to take shape as far back as 2016 did that job.As of last week, however, both of those lines have failed to remain a technical floor. Worse, as of Thursday and Friday of last week, the 200-day moving average line seems to be acting as a resistance level.Click to Enlarge• The daily chart of HP offers the details of the new dynamic. Shares plunged two weeks ago, leaving behind a gap. The bulls tried to rebound on Thursday, but once the gap was closed, the bears dug in again, with the 200-day line never being crossed above again.• The weekly chart offers some perspective the daily chart doesn’t. It’s in this timeframe we can see the momentum has been slowly shifting from bullishness to bearishness.• The clincher is Monday’s low of $22.27. If HP stock breaks under that level, odds are good another wave of would-be sellers could dump their stake, putting a selling avalanche in place.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

These weekly gains helped all the three major indexes to end last month in green.But, it was the most popular trade over the past one and a half period that has given way in November to another sector that has now taken the baton of leadership on Wall Street. The healthcare sector registered a gain of more than 6% in November, while one of the new entrants among the S&P 500’s 11 sectors, communications services that include Facebook, Inc.

AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Netflix Inc. NFLX and Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL may not be a one-off, market pundits said.Continuous innovation and research in the field of biotechnology and an increasingly aged population in the United States are helping whet appetite for healthcare shares.Moreover, this particular sector is more defensive in nature compared to other major S&P 500 sectors like technology. Thus, their demand has increased by leaps and bounds as U.S. economic expansion is widely expected to slow down in the coming years owing to the waning effect of the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts.Also, whether the stock market is a bull or bear one, the need for medical and health care products is constant.

NFLX,12-02-2018 06:11PM,Netflix Makes an Unprecedented Move in Pursuit of Oscar Gold,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-makes-unprecedented-move-pursuit-150500612.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.In its push to change the Hollywood landscape, streaming pioneer Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has long stuck to its guns, insisting that it would only release films in theaters at the same time they debuted on its streaming service. It seems that the company has finally broken that long-standing edict, electing to give several high-profile movies exclusive theatrical runs before making them available for streaming.The catalyst behind Netflix's change of heart appears to be its quest for Hollywood recognition, as the company is making a major push to increase its chances of taking home award-show gold.The Alfonso Cuaron-helmed ""Roma"" is getting plenty of awards buzz. Image source: Netflix.Netflix finally broke its long-standing tradition for Academy Award-winning director and writer Alfonso Cuaron, whose black-and-white drama Roma has generated significant buzz on the film festival circuit. The movie, which explores Cuaron's memories of his childhood, has emerged as a potential front-runner in several awards categories, including the coveted Best Picture. Cuaron took home the Best Director Oscar for his smash hit Gravity. He is also known for other groundbreaking Oscar-nominated films, such as Children of Men and Y Tu Mama Tambien, as well as for his work on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.Roma was released in theaters on Nov. 21, a full three weeks before it will be available to Netflix subscribers. This is one of several prestige projects that are said to be getting the ""Cuaron treatment."" The Coen brothers' Western anthology The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Susanne Bier's Bird Box, and the Andy Serkis-helmed Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle all received exclusive limited engagements in theaters before hitting the Netflix queue.Cuaron explained why the film needed to be released in theaters as well:Seeing Roma on the big screen is just as important as ensuring people all over the world have the chance to experience it in their homes. ... Roma was photographed in expansive 65mm, complemented by a very complex [Dolby] Atmos sound mix. While a movie theater offers the best possible experience for Roma, it was designed to be equally meaningful when experienced in the intimacy of one's home.It's also worth noting that Roma opened to sell-out crowds during its five-day Thanksgiving weekend debut. The film netted about $200,000 at the box office, according to Deadline Hollywood, a respectable haul for a foreign-language film.Netflix has been largely snubbed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which presents the Oscars. The subject has been hotly debated among moviemakers, with some saying that Netflix shouldn't be eligible for Oscar consideration. Still others believe that old-school traditionalists who vote for the Oscars will be more likely to consider a film that has had a lengthier run.Several previous Netflix-branded movies have been nominated in the past, but the company has only taken home awards for two documentaries: White Helmets, which followed the efforts of aid workers in Syria, and Icarus, which chronicled an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs by world-class cyclists.The Andy Serkis-directed ""Mowgli"" is getting an exclusive theatrical run. Image source: Netflix.Netflix executives have long argued that the company's subscribers, who currently number more than 135 million worldwide, deserve to see movies at the same time they are released in theaters. The company has also balked at the traditional practice of ""windowing,"" which kept films from being available for home viewing for at least 90 days after their debut in cinemas.This practice put the company at odds with the major theater chains, which refused to show Netflix's creations, forcing the company to make deals with smaller art house cinemas in order to meet the criteria necessary for Oscar consideration. This latest development shows that the company is at least open to taking a more traditional approach for select, higher-profile fare.Netflix has achieved a fair degree of recognition for its television series, having received 112 Emmy nominations this year. This topped AT&T's HBO, which had held the crown for most nominations for 17 consecutive years. Netflix also tied HBO's Emmy awards haul with 23 statues.For all its success in television, Netflix hasn't fared as well in the movie category. Its recent push is a sign that the company is getting increasingly serious in its desire for Oscar gold. The prestige the company would gain would be a selling point for future subscribers, and would also further blur the line between traditional box-office releases and Netflix original movies.More From The Motley FoolDanny Vena owns shares of Netflix.

NFLX,12-03-2018 02:12PM,Black Mirror's Return Teased In Deleted Netflix Tweet,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/black-mirrors-return-teased-deleted-223859756.html,"Leave BlankThe fourth season of Black Mirror arrived on Netflix nearly a year ago, and while we know that Charlie Brooker's acclaimed sci-fi satire is set to return at some point, it hasn't been clear when this would be. However, a now-deleted tweet from the streaming giant suggests we might be getting some more Black Mirror before the end of the year.As reported by Forbes, Netflix tweeted a list of shows and movies that are set to debut on the service throughout December. While most of these have already been announced, there was one title that had not--Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, which is seemingly scheduled for December 28. The tweet was rapidly deleted, but not before it was screen-captured.Mr. America: What’s more, even though Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claimed to be a daughter of a “small businessman,” and a mother who “cleaned houses,” her father, Sergio Ocasio-Roman, was born in New York City and was a prominent architect, having founded the firm Kirschenbaum & Ocasio-Roman Architects, PC. According to its Manta listing, the company boasted an annual revenue of $500,000 per year.

Sergio Ocasio-Roman died from lung cancer in 2008Ocasio-Cortez attended public school in Yorktown, where homes sell for nearly $900,000, according to Trulia. In her official biography, however, Ocasio-Cortez claimed that she was born and raised in the Bronx, and completely omitted her time in the ritzy upstate suburb.

Because so little was known about the candidate before her shocking defeat of the incumbent, Joe Crowley, it was easy for this to fly under the radar for most New Yorkers who were in her governing district.
But now, a new, explosive report from the Daily Mail suggests that the candidate is actually lying about her working-class roots.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who posits herself as a “socialist” who fights for New York’s working class — and is especially favorable to the “Bernie Bro” demographic for that reason — actually grew up in Westchester County, which is a ritzy suburb of New York City.The outlet reports that Ocasio-Cortez’s father chose to move the family to the suburb in 1991 because of the “good school districts” in the area — school districts which didn’t exist in the Bronx.
Her mother, meanwhile, confirmed the family’s move to Westchester County in her own interview with the New York Times, and said that it was her mother — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s grandmother — that cleaned houses in Puerto Rico, not her.

In fact, Ocasio-Cortez won several science competitions in high school and was on the dean’s list at Boston University. After college, she founded a children’s book publishing company that sought to portray the Bronx in a positive light.

That all is a far cry from the “hard-knock life” that Ocasio-Cortez claims to have had.

And although Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did not return the Daily Mail’s request for a comment about the matter, she’s still expected to be a shoo-in for the NY-14 House of Representatives seat, because it’s a historically liberal district in New York.4.6k"

MTCH,12-03-2018 10:12AM,Some Pre-Earnings Homework for Momo Stock Followers,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pre-earnings-homework-momo-stock-183433992.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Growth isn’t the issue for China’s Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO); it has been able to do that in spades. Rather, the yardstick by which Momo stock has been and still is judged is the pace of its growth. Anything less than red-hot forward progress has been viewed as a letdown, despite topping earnings estimates in each of its past eleven quarters.It would also be naive to pretend it hasn’t been lumped in with the likes of Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and other Chinese tech stocks. The escalating trade war and subsequent economic slowdown for the world’s second-biggest economy had spooked investors.With the tariff showdown currently taking a cease-fire and likely to be closer to its end than not though, in addition to a garden-variety oversold condition, Thursday’s earnings report may well light a fire under Momo stock again. The chart’s certainly set up for such a move.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe key will be what kind of mood investors are in at the time… will they be optimistic, or pessimistic?Originally scheduled for Wednesday morning, China’s online dating platform Momo rescheduled the report on Monday in light of the fact that U.S. markets will be closed on Dec. 5 to honor the passing of former President George HW Bush. The report and corresponding conference call are now both slated for Thursday morning, before the market opens.The delay won’t change the numbers, however, which on a relative basis should be impressive enough.As of the latest look, analysts are calling for third-quarter earnings of 54 cents per share on sales of $533.6 million. Both will be up from the year-ago comparables of 45 cents per share of MOMO stock, and a top line of $354.5 million, extending a long streak of sizable organic and non-organic growth.The numbers, of course, are only part of the story.Though Momo has introduced its own tweaks to make its take on love connections more captivating, it has also bought some of its growth. Early this year it acquired Tantan, the so-called Tinder of China, making it more like its diversified western counterpart Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), which operates Match.com, Tinder, Our Time and other online dating sites. Integration with Tantan continues.Also, like any other social networking company, current and would-be owners of MOMO stock will be looking at the number of regular users the company’s sites boasts and how long they’re logged in. During the second quarter of this year, its platforms counted 108 million regular monthly users, and total paying users of its live video service reached 11.6 million a quarter earlier. Both figures will need to grow respectably for the third quarter to be considered a success. The amount of time spent per user using the app during the second quarter was up 11% year-over-year, and that number would also ideally increase.The one soft spot that could become a pitfall? Mobile games. Revenue fell 40% during the second quarter … the only arm to see a sales decline.And, the weighing all of those factors will be further impacted by politics.The tariff war had undoubtedly crimped China’s economy at a time when it couldn’t afford to be crimped. A combination of wage headwinds and slowing job growth — or at least fear of them — has proven problematic.

Putting yourself out there can be as easy as setting up a free online profile. And it's not just soulmate-seekers getting hooked up in cyberspace. Investors in some of the leading players in online dating are also scoring.Shares of Tinder parent Match Group (NASDAQ: MTCH) have been some of the biggest dot-com winners over the past two years. Although the stock has corrected sharply along with most online growth stocks, shedding more than a third of its value since peaking two months ago, it's still up 112% since the beginning of 2017.Beyond Tinder and its namesake Match.com, Match Group also plays digital matchmaker for singles on Plenty of Fish, OkCupid, and several other social introductory sites. Match Group is growing quickly and it's profitable, but there's another online dating specialist that's growing even faster and trading for less than half of Match Group's earnings multiple. Let's go all the way to China, where Momo (NASDAQ: MOMO) is living up to its name by offering more momentum than Match Group.Image source: Momo.Match Group has earned its stripes. Revenue rose 29% in its latest quarter, as a 23% increase in average subscribers and a 6% uptick in average revenue per user combined to deliver top-line growth that exceeded Match Group's earlier guidance as well as Wall Street's expectations. Adjusted earnings roughly doubled to $0.39 a share, also topping analyst profit targets.Momo is growing its top line even faster. The Chinese dot-com got its start as an online dating site but is now gaining traction for its social video hub, which appeals to singles and non-singles alike. Revenue soared 58% for its second quarter, and adjusted earnings nearly doubled. Momo will report its third-quarter financials next week.Guidance tripped Match Group up earlier this month. It sees revenue growth slowing to 16% to 19% in the current quarter, its weakest increase since the springtime of last year. If Match Group lands at the low end of its top-line range, we'd be looking at its first sequential dip after 10 quarters of upticks.We'll have to wait and see if Momo also offers uninspiring guidance when it reports next Wednesday, but it's fair to say that Momo and its country-specific platform will have a different outlook from Match Group and its global angle. In terms of momentum, it's worth noting that Momo has blasted through Wall Street's earnings projections in each of the past six quarters, double Match Group's current winning streak.Match Group and Momo have a pulse on what singles are seeking, and the growing popularity at Tinder and Momo find both companies cashing in on premium subscriptions. Success at both companies has translated into healthy profitability, but the valuations aren't the same. Match Group is now fetching 26 times this year's projected earnings and 23 times next year's multiple, a reasonable valuation for the undisputed market leader. However, Momo is the one turning heads, at less than 12 times this year's multiple and a little more than 9 times next year's projected profit.Momo is the riskier of the two stocks, given its concentration in China, but the valuation gap is too wide to ignore. It also helps that Momo has yet to disappoint investors in the third quarter, as Match Group already did a few weeks ago, with its weak guidance and head-scratching special dividend declaration.Match Group has too many of its eggs in the Tinder basket, so it's not a lot less risky than Momo. It's a smart investment, but Momo is even smarter at this point.More From The Motley FoolRick Munarriz has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Match Group and Momo.

MOMO,12-03-2018 10:12AM,Some Pre-Earnings Homework for Momo Stock Followers,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pre-earnings-homework-momo-stock-183433992.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Growth isn’t the issue for China’s Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO); it has been able to do that in spades. Rather, the yardstick by which Momo stock has been and still is judged is the pace of its growth. Anything less than red-hot forward progress has been viewed as a letdown, despite topping earnings estimates in each of its past eleven quarters.It would also be naive to pretend it hasn’t been lumped in with the likes of Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and other Chinese tech stocks. The escalating trade war and subsequent economic slowdown for the world’s second-biggest economy had spooked investors.With the tariff showdown currently taking a cease-fire and likely to be closer to its end than not though, in addition to a garden-variety oversold condition, Thursday’s earnings report may well light a fire under Momo stock again. The chart’s certainly set up for such a move.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe key will be what kind of mood investors are in at the time… will they be optimistic, or pessimistic?Originally scheduled for Wednesday morning, China’s online dating platform Momo rescheduled the report on Monday in light of the fact that U.S. markets will be closed on Dec. 5 to honor the passing of former President George HW Bush. The report and corresponding conference call are now both slated for Thursday morning, before the market opens.The delay won’t change the numbers, however, which on a relative basis should be impressive enough.As of the latest look, analysts are calling for third-quarter earnings of 54 cents per share on sales of $533.6 million. Both will be up from the year-ago comparables of 45 cents per share of MOMO stock, and a top line of $354.5 million, extending a long streak of sizable organic and non-organic growth.The numbers, of course, are only part of the story.Though Momo has introduced its own tweaks to make its take on love connections more captivating, it has also bought some of its growth. Early this year it acquired Tantan, the so-called Tinder of China, making it more like its diversified western counterpart Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), which operates Match.com, Tinder, Our Time and other online dating sites. Integration with Tantan continues.Also, like any other social networking company, current and would-be owners of MOMO stock will be looking at the number of regular users the company’s sites boasts and how long they’re logged in. During the second quarter of this year, its platforms counted 108 million regular monthly users, and total paying users of its live video service reached 11.6 million a quarter earlier. Both figures will need to grow respectably for the third quarter to be considered a success. The amount of time spent per user using the app during the second quarter was up 11% year-over-year, and that number would also ideally increase.The one soft spot that could become a pitfall? Mobile games. Revenue fell 40% during the second quarter … the only arm to see a sales decline.And, the weighing all of those factors will be further impacted by politics.The tariff war had undoubtedly crimped China’s economy at a time when it couldn’t afford to be crimped. A combination of wage headwinds and slowing job growth — or at least fear of them — has proven problematic. The agreement between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping to call a truce to the tariff war can only help put Momo’s third quarter in a positive light, though the agreement between the two leaders is far from binding.While the character and quality of Momo’s earnings are key to the stock’s response to the news, just as telling right now is the technical read in Momo stock. It’s perfectly positioned to bounce, though if it doesn’t, it’s also perfectly positioned to suffer another wave of selling.Click to Enlarge Take a look.

MOMO,11-28-2018 06:12PM,Is the Options Market Predicting a Spike in Momo (MOMO) Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-market-predicting-spike-momo-133801632.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Investors in Momo Inc. MOMO need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 7, 2018 $35.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Momo shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Momo is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Internet - Software and Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 55 cents per share to 53 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Momo right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

MOMO,11-28-2018 06:12PM,Momo Inc. (MOMO) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/momo-inc-momo-gains-lags-225010816.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.In the latest trading session, Momo Inc. (MOMO) closed at $30.02, marking a +1.04% move from the previous day. The stock lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 2.3%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 2.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 2.95%.Coming into today, shares of the company had lost 3.04% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 1.65%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.21%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from MOMO as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be December 5, 2018. In that report, analysts expect MOMO to post earnings of $0.53 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 17.78%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $536 million, up 51.22% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.45 per share and revenue of $2.03 billion. These totals would mark changes of +38.42% and +53.7%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for MOMO. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3.04% lower. MOMO is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that MOMO has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.14 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 31.05, so we one might conclude that MOMO is trading at a discount comparatively.Investors should also note that MOMO has a PEG ratio of 0.53 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MOMO's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.43 as of yesterday's close.The Internet - Software and Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 166, putting it in the bottom 35% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

MOMO,11-27-2018 06:12PM,8 China Stocks With Long-Term Upside,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-china-stocks-long-term-201637064.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The recent U.S. stock market rout started in early October. But many months before U.S. stocks started falling off a cliff, China stocks were dropping into correction territory.The rationale behind the selloff in China stocks is pretty straightforward. The China economy has been flashing warning signs of cooling off for several months, while the U.S. dollar has concurrently strengthened. Amid this economic slowdown and U.S. dollar uptick, U.S. and China trade tensions have not improved, and the probability of bigger and more wide-sweeping tariffs coming in 2019 is now quite high. Bigger tariffs could accentuate China’s economic slowdown, and this will inevitably result in slower growth numbers across all of China’s big companies.This is the mindset investors have taken with China stocks over the past several months. It’s quite bearish. But, it isn’t wrong, either. China’s economy is slowing, and tariffs could slow things down even more. As such, the near term outlook for China stocks is fairly bearish.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut while the near-term outlook is bearish, the long-term outlook is bullish.In the big picture, this is still a country with over a billion people, most of whom are rapidly urbanizing and digitizing. GDP growth is still in excess of 6%, while household income and expenditures per capita still remain a fraction of what they are in the U.S. Long term, the consumer landscape of China will increasingly look like the consumer landscape in America, implying that big growth is here to stay for the next several years. As this urbanization narrative matures over the next several years, China stocks should bounce back.With that in mind, here’s a list of eight China stocks with exposure to all of China’s most promising growth themes, making these stocks the most likely to rally in a big way once near term risks pass.Source: ShutterstockAt the top of this list is China’s most well-known and biggest tech company, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).For all intents and purposes, Alibaba is the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China. They have a huge and rapidly growing e-commerce business. They also have a huge and rapidly growing cloud business. There is also a big-growth digital advertising business, a rapidly expanding offline retail business and a still-developing AI businesses. All together, both companies have consistently exhibited 20%-plus revenue growth.There’s just three big differences between the fundamentals of Amazon and the fundamentals of Alibaba. One, Alibaba is far more profitable. Alibaba’s operating margins are around 20%. Amazon’s are near 5%. Two, Alibaba is growing way faster. Alibaba’s revenue growth was in excess of 50% last quarter. Amazon’s was below 30%. Three, Alibaba stock is way cheaper. Alibaba stock trades at under 30X forward earnings. Amazon stock trades at 80X forward earnings.The big reason Alibaba stock is way cheaper has two parts. First, Alibaba is cheaper because of near-term headline risks inherent to the Chinese economy — but eventually, these headline risks will pass. Second, Alibaba is cheaper because margins are compressing, not expanding. Margin compression is a temporary phenomena sparked by big growth-related investments that will pass with time.As such, the headwinds keeping Alibaba stock are short-sighted in nature, while the tailwinds are long-running. This makes Alibaba stock a likely candidate for a big bounce once U.S. and China trade relations improve.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrSecond on this list is Alibaba’s competitor and China’s second biggest e-retailer, JD (NASDAQ:JD).Much like Alibaba, JD is a hyper-growth tech giant powered by a rapidly growing e-commerce business. Also much like Alibaba, the big problem with JD is slowing revenue growth and margin compression against the backdrop of a Chinese economy that is rapidly cooling. Last quarter’s 25% revenue growth rate pales in comparison to the year ago quarter’s 40% growth rate, while operating margins are down 90 basis points year-to-date to a measly 0.5%.Until revenue growth or margin expansion trends turn around, JD stock won’t rebound.Fortunately, they should be able to turn around. Slower growth recently is a reflection of economic uncertainty in China due to strained trade relations. Eventually, those trade relations will improve, and when they do, JD’s revenue growth should bounce back. Plus, growth should get a big lift as the company expands internationally into new markets.Moreover, much like at Alibaba, margin compression at JD is a temporary phenomena driven by growth-related investments that will inevitably phase out over time.Thus, in the big picture, JD is just fine. The bull thesis is predicated on valuation. At current levels, JD stock is trading at less than 0.5X trailing sales. That multiple strongly implies continued revenue growth deceleration and continued margin compression. From this perspective, the current valuation on JD gives this China stock ample room to run higher when revenue growth and margin trends reverse course.Source: ShutterstockNext up on this list is the company which many consider to be the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of China, Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).Much like the other stocks on this list, WB stock has dropped due to a combination of slowing growth, trade risks, and margin headwinds. But, also much like other stocks on this list, these headwinds are temporary, while the company’s tailwinds are robust and long running.The long term fundamentals underlying Weibo stock are quite promising. You have a red hot social media company that has 430 million monthly active users and is consistently adding about 20 million new users every quarter. You have revenue growth that was in excess of 60% last quarter. Also, margins are stable year-over-year.This growth isn’t going anywhere any time soon. Weibo has generated just $1.5 billion in trailing twelve month revenues on 430 million users. Its U.S. comp, Twitter, has generated nearly twice as much on 100 million fewer users. When all is said and done and the China and U.S. digital ad landscapes are both mature, there is no reason why Wiebo’s users should generate less revenue than Twitter’s users. Thus, Weibo has a tremendous runway ahead to scale ARPU to Twitter levels.This robust unit growth potential on top of consistent user growth will power continued 20%-plus revenue growth for many years to come. Meanwhile, margins should at worst remain stable, and more realistically grow with robust revenue growth. That implies something to the tune of 20% to 30% earnings growth over the next several years.WB stock trades at just 18X forward earnings. Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) trades at a slightly higher multiple. That makes no sense.Source: ShutterstockAnother China stock with hulking long-term upside is live streaming and social media company Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO).Momo is a really good company doing innovative things in a really good space. Momo’s business most closely resembles Tinder, as the platform is designed to be a couples and friends match-making service. This is a good space to be in. It runs parallel to the whole social media growth narrative playing out in China, but also evades competition because it is niche and designed for a purpose unmet by other Chinese social platforms.But, Momo is much more than just China’s Tinder. The company is a leader in China’s booming live-streaming market. To be sure, growth in this market is decelerating and the Chinese government is starting to step in and crack down. But mobile phone penetration and usage is only going up from here, and with it goes mobile video consumption and live-streaming. As Elijah Whaley, CMO of ParkLu, which manages Chinese live-streaming stars, observed: “Mass programming cannot satisfy niche interests.”Overall, the growth narrative at Momo is not broken. Recent numbers affirm this. Q2 was a clean double-beat-and-raise quarter for Momo that comprised nearly 60% revenue growth and 90% profit growth.Like many China stocks, the bull thesis on MOMO stock is predicated on valuation. Despite continued strong numbers, Momo has sold off in sympathy with other China stocks. Consequently, MOMO stock now trades at just 13X forward earnings. That multiple makes no sense next to 90% profit growth last quarter, nor next to the company’s strong growth fundamentals in China’s still rapidly growing digital economy. As such, once near-term headline risks pass, MOMO stock could bounce back in a big way.Source: Thomas Galvez via FlickrA list of China stocks with long-term upside would be incomplete without including China’s go-to online travel site, Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP).Often referred to as the Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) of China, Ctrip was a big winner for the better part of the past decade thanks to a boom in China air travel. As China consumers have urbanized and earned more, they have naturally wanted to travel more and spend those new dollars seeing the world. As such, the narrative at Ctrip has been one characterized by robust and consistent top and bottom line growth.This narrative is slowing now. Last quarter, revenue growth was just 20%. In the year ago quarter, it was over 40%. Moreover, revenue growth next quarter is expected to be below 20%. This slowdown can be attributed to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty in China, and will persist so long as such uncertainty remains.But, that uncertainty won’t remain forever, and the long-term fundamentals here are really good. Just 7% of Chinese citizens have a passport. That is really low. In America, that figure stands closer to 40%. Moreover, Chinese tourists made just 145 million overseas visits last year, which equates to just 10% of the total population. Because of this, the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute (COTRI) predicts that overseas trips will grow from 145 million last year, to over 400 million by 2030.Naturally, as this growth narrative plays out, CTRP stock will be a big winner. As such, once near-term headline risks pass, CTRP stock should grow alongside a still burgeoning China air travel growth narrative.Source: ShutterstockChinese digital search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has not been spared in the recent China stock market rout. The stock peaked in May 2018 at over $280. Since then, BIDU has dropped more than 35% to $180.Much like the other stocks on this list, Baidu has been hampered by a combination of headwinds. Revenue growth is slowing. Margins are under pressure. Forward growth estimates are coming down. Analysts are growing increasingly pessimistic.But, beyond the noise, the long term fundamentals supporting Baidu stock are still pretty strong. Baidu is China’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and as China’s Google, Baidu provides the backbone for China’s internet. Beyond that, Baidu has high-growth cloud, IoT, and AI businesses, the sum of which are still in the early stages of a multiyear growth narrative.All together, so long as internet usage continues to rise in China and enterprise investment into things like cloud and AI continues to grow, Baidu’s growth fundamentals should remain strong. That is a promising read. But, the big concern here is margin compression (operating margins were down 500 basis points last quarter). Until those margins reverse course, BIDU stock won’t bounce back.Margins should bounce back in the medium to long term. Over the next several years, digital advertising, AI, IoT and cloud growth will likely power 15%-20% revenue growth at Baidu. During that stretch, it will be tough for expenses to keep up with revenue. Right now, Baidu is being weighed by huge losses at iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) and big investments into the app ecosystem. Eventually, iQiyi’s margins will improve with scale, and big investments into apps will scale back once the app ecosystem is fully fleshed out. When that happens, these big expenses dragging margins down will phase out, and margins will ramp higher on a much bigger revenue base.Thus, BIDU stock has big bounce back potential at current levels. The stock won’t realize that potential until margins stabilize and/or the trade situation improves. But, these aren’t a matter of “if.” They are a matter of “when.”Source: ShutterstockChinese internet giant Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has had an especially tough 2018. Tencent stock peaked in January 2018 at over $60, and now trades below $40.The big problem here is revenue deceleration. Margins are compressing, but they’ve been compressing for the past several years. In early 2015, TCEHY had 60%-plus gross margins and 40%-plus operating margins. Big investments and a shift to lower-margin revenue streams have dragged margins way down since then. Today, Tencent has 47% gross margins and 30% operating margins, and both of those metrics are rapidly dropping.But, margin compression wasn’t a big problem for Tencent from 2015 to 2017 because revenue growth was big enough to offset margin compression. That is no longer the case. Last quarter, revenue growth decelerated meaningfully. That deceleration negatively impacted the company’s bottom line, as its operating profits actually dropped year-over-year.Therefore, unless Tencent’s revenue growth re-accelerates or its margin declines moderate, the outlook for Tencent’s profit growth isn’t all the great. At this point, with the Chinese economy slowing, no positive progress on U.S.-China trade talks, and Tencent’s top- and bottom-line issues, there is little reason to believe TCEHY stock will reach a positive turning point anytime soon.Long term, though, the upside is compelling. This is a company with robust exposure to all things internet in China. Tencent operates China’s largest social media platforms — Weixin and WeChat — and they have more than 1 billion combined active users. The company’s other social media and communication apps — QQ and Qzone — aren’t small either. They both have 500 million-plus monthly active users. Beyond social, Tencent is also the gaming giant in China, and it’s the top online games maker by revenue in the world. TCEHY also owns China’s biggest digital video, news, music, and literature platforms. As if that weren’t enough, Tencent also operates China’s largest mobile payment platform and its largest mobile security network.In other words, TCEHY not only has exposure to all things internet in China, it actually dominates all things internet in China. Thus, as goes the outlook for the growth of internet services in China, so goes Tencent. Considering that demand for internet services is expected to continue growing rapidly in China, Tencent stock is still supported by a favorable multiyear growth outlook.As a result, in the big picture, the near-term weakness of TCEHY stock price is a long-term buying opportunity. But, investors will want to wait for revenue growth turn the corner and/or margin declines to moderate before buying the dip.Source: ShutterstockThe riskiest yet potentially most rewarding stock on this list is Huya (NASDAQ:HUYA).Huya is China’s leading video streaming platform, and that inherently implies huge speculative long-term growth potential for this stock. Across the globe, live streaming video game viewership numbers are skyrocketing, and everyone from Amazon to Google to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is investing big into this market.But the biggest growth is happening China, where Huya reigns supreme. China is the world’s largest games market in terms of revenue and gamers. In 2017, gaming revenues were $32.2 billion in China, versus $26.4 billion the U.S. The disparity is mostly driven by the fact that China has 646 million gamers, essentially double the entire U.S. population.And this disparity is expected to only widen. Over the next five years, an expansion in China’s gamer base from 646 million to 917 million is expected to drive 13% compounded annual growth in gaming revenues. Meanwhile, in the U.S., gaming revenues are expected to grow at a mere 5% clip over the next five years.Clearly, China is the big growth story here. And when it comes to China video game live streaming, Huya is king with almost 50% market share (83 million monthly active users last year versus China gaming monthly users of 180 million).Consequently, as the China eSports and live streaming markets explode higher over the next several years, Huya stock should climb higher, too. But, this bull thesis isn’t without risk. Recent weak quarterly numbers imply market share erosion and slowing growth. If these trends persist, Huya stock will be stuck in its current downtrend.As such, the long-term growth narrative on Huya stock is promising. But, there are near term risks which should investors on the sidelines for the near term.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA, AMZN, WB, BIDU, GOOG, and FB.Compare BrokersThe post 8 China Stocks With Long-Term Upside appeared first on InvestorPlace."
PCTY,12-01-2018 06:12PM,Paylocity (PCTY) Up 1.4% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paylocity-pcty-1-4-since-143102000.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Paylocity (PCTY). Shares have added about 1.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Paylocity due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Paylocity Q4 Earnings Lag, Revenues Top EstimatesPaylocity reported mixed fiscal first-quarter 2019 results, wherein the top line beat estimates but the bottom line missed the same.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 20 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure, however, increased 33.3% from the year-ago quarter.Quarter DetailsPaylocity’s revenues of $100.5 million increased 26% year over year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $98 million.The top line was driven by a 25.8% rise in recurring revenues (99% of total revenues), which totaled $99.3 million. New client wins and a rise in average revenue per client, given the momentum of the company’s newest product offerings, drove results.For the quarter, broker referrals represented more than 25% of new business. The company’s investment in the channel is aiding the number of brokers and helping to create stronger relationships with current partners.However, a 52% decline in Implementation services and other revenues was a dampener.MarginsThe company’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $70.4 million, up 37.7% year over year. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 730 basis points year over year to 70%.Adjusted EBITDA increased 59.4% from the year-ago quarter to $23.3 million.Non-GAAP operating income was $15.3 million compared with $8.2 million a year ago.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowPaylocity exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $63.7 million compared with $137.2 million in the previous quarter.During the quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $7.3 million compared with $8.2 million in the prior-year quarter.Product UpdateThe company announced the addition of TPA solutions, which will be available in the first quarter of 2019. The addition of Health Savings Account and Flexible Spending Account is expected to provide “users with a single unified access point for payroll, HR and benefits administration” adds management.Moreover, the company introduced new functionalities in HCM solutions. The company also launched a free additional self-service information resource called Paylocity Education and Knowledge or PEAK. It contains supplemental training materials and trending topics for payroll and HCM professionals, management stated.GuidanceThe company provided guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2019. For the fiscal second quarter, Paylocity expects revenues in the range of $104-$105 million. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $23.5-$24.5 million.For fiscal 2019, it now anticipates revenues in the range of $453-$455 million, up from $451-$453 million projected earlier.Adjusted EBITDA guidance was maintained in the range of $126.5 million to $128.5 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -43.59% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Paylocity has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. Notably, Paylocity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PYPL,12-03-2018 02:12PM,Better Buy: PayPal Holdings vs. American Express,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-buy-paypal-holdings-vs-220300830.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The payments market has been a field ripe with investment opportunity lately. Digital-payment providers such as PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) are seeing robust growth as millions of consumers choose the convenience of an app to send money to family or friends and buy things in a store.But American Express (NYSE: AXP) is still one of the world's top brands in the payments space, and it's seen strong growth lately, too. Let's see which of these two dominant payment providers investors should buy today.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Shares of the digital-payments leader are up about 8% over the past year, barely keeping ahead of the broader market. That probably has more to do with investors who are trying to wrap their heads around the stock's high valuation than with how the business is performing.The company posted another stellar quarter last month, with revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share up 14% and 26%, respectively. These numbers are typical of how the company performs every quarter. In this case, revenue was much better than the reported number. The recent sale of PayPal's credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Financial shaved about seven percentage points off the top line. So adjusting for that, PayPal's revenue grew 21% year over year.To keep the momentum going, management is starting to allocate capital to adjacent growth opportunities outside its core payments platform that extends the company's reach further across the digital-payments landscape. Back in June, the company announced a handful of acquisitions totaling $2.7 billion across point-of-sale solutions, risk management, and marketplace payments.These moves were partly the result of the $6.5 billion in cash proceeds PayPal received from Synchrony in exchange for the credit receivables sale. PayPal also generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow over the past year and ended the quarter with $10.5 billion in cash and investments and just $2 billion in short-term debt.There's a massive digital-payments market out there, and PayPal has the resources to make some big splashes. What's more, the company plans to distribute 40% to 50% of its free cash flow to shareholders over the next five years, probably in the form of share repurchases. Management is also targeting $1 billion to $3 billion in acquisitions each year.If you're willing to pay a high P/E to own the shares, PayPal has a lot of growth potential to offer investors.IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN EXPRESS.Instead of being a fierce competitor, American Express has considered PayPal a valuable partner. In the third quarter, the two payment leaders joined forces, in a move that will extend AmEx's reach into digital payments. As for PayPal, it completes the circle of credit card partnerships it's made over the past few years as part of its open platform strategy.American Express has a lot to gain from this partnership. It extends the company's reach to the millions of PayPal users who use American Express. Card members will be able to pay their AmEx bill directly out of their PayPal or Venmo balance. PayPal users will also be able to access their AmEx reward points, which is a big deal for American Express, since card member benefits are at the heart of the company's competitive advantage.American Express spends billions every year on card member rewards and services to provide card members something in return for the annual fee they spend to have an American Express card. The company also offers an array of merchant services in return for the fees it charges merchants for accepting AmEx. Merchants are willing to pay this fee because they know AmEx card members spend more than any other cardholder, which helps generate more sales to grow their business.Since most of the company's revenue is derived from merchant and card member fees, the growth of AmEx's revenue is a direct reflection of customer satisfaction and the relevance of its brand. The stock price is up 20% over the past year following strong operating results. Management expects full-year revenue to grow 9% to 10% and non-GAAP earnings per share to grow about 24% to 26% over 2017.It's encouraging to see this level of growth, because American Express is facing mounting competition from merchants that are investing in their own payment solutions, as well as from emerging technologies at digital-payment providers like PayPal and Square.Even more encouraging is that management reported last quarter that about half of the new card members for its Platinum card are millennials. In total, AmEx acquired 3 million new cards last quarter, which shows consumers still place a high value on the things American Express is known for, such as its customer service and free airport lounge access. These are services that no other payment provider has been able to match.This one is a close call. American Express shares look appealing at a forward P/E of 14 times next year's earnings estimates. If the company can keep posting growth rates as it did in the third quarter, the shares offer good return potential.PayPal is growing the top line much faster, but investors have to pay up for that growth, with the shares currently fetching a forward P/E of 29.The one knock against American Express is that it's having to spend on card member services at a faster rate than revenue to drive growth, which could be indicative of an increasing competitive environment. For now, this isn't hurting AmEx, as card spending has been growing and card members seem to be satisfied with AmEx's service. But if competition ramps up enough, this extra spending could potentially cut into the company's margins and earnings growth over time.Also, since American Express issues its own cards, it carries credit risk, something PayPal limited with the Synchrony deal.It's more expensive from a valuation perspective, but I think investors will be better off over the long term with PayPal.More From The Motley FoolJohn Ballard owns shares of PayPal Holdings. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends PayPal Holdings and Square.

PYPL,12-01-2018 06:12PM,Will Venmo Fraud Derail PayPal's Meteoric Growth?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/venmo-fraud-derail-paypal-apos-170600845.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has produced significant growth over the past several years and shows no signs of slowing. One of the biggest potential growth drivers is that of Venmo, the company's person-to-person social payments platform. While the service is already a hit with millennials, PayPal recently rolled out a ""Pay with Venmo"" button that allowed users to pay for commercial transactions as well, adding to its increasing popularity and utility.With all that potential, however, comes a fair degree of risk. Fraudulent transactions plagued the up-and-coming service earlier this year, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. Things got even worse, as attempts to combat the rise in fraud caused the company to suspend certain features on the platform, which resulted in an outcry from users.In light of these recent events, do PayPal investors have reason to be concerned, or is this just a part of doing business?Will fraud stunt Venmo's growth? Image source: PayPal.During the first quarter of this year, Venmo posted an operating loss of $40 million, 40% worse than the company anticipated, according to the report. One of the biggest contributors to this was an increase in the transaction loss rate, which is partially composed of reimbursements to users as the result of fraudulent activity. This rate climbed from 0.25% of Venmo's payment volume in January to 0.40% in March. For perspective, the company was anticipating an overall rate of 0.24% for the quarter.The surge in illegal activity appeared to catch PayPal off guard, and the company reacted by temporarily discontinuing certain features that it believed were contributing to the problem. Venmo customers weren't allowed to instantly transfer funds to their bank accounts, and tens of thousands of accounts identified as suspect were suspended. The company also discontinued the practice of allowing users to transfer money via its website -- though the majority of customers only used the app on their smartphone anyway.While the measures employed helped to limit the losses from fraud, they also inconvenienced many legitimate users, who had transactions delayed or declined due to the short-term crackdown.PayPal reps downplayed the temporary spike in fraudulent Venmo transactions, pointing out that Venmo rolled out new features during the first quarter and saying that there's typically an increase in such losses for a short time following the introduction of new features.""Venmo loss levels are lower than the overall average for PayPal and compare favorably to the industry,"" a PayPal spokesperson said. The rep also noted that the losses for the first quarter were less than 0.35% and have declined ever since. As the company got a handle on the fraudulent activity, it restored users' ability to transfer funds instantly.Venmo generated $54 billion in total payment volume on a trailing-12-month basis and grew 78% year over year in the most recent quarter. The ability for users to pay merchants using a Venmo account is just getting started, and could represent a significant growth area for PayPal.Earlier this year, Third Point hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb took a stake in PayPal, citing Venmo as one of the principal motivators for his investment. Loeb noted that Venmo had grown 25 times over the previous four years and had grown to represent 10% of PayPal's total transaction volume. He went on to say, ""We think Venmo can contribute $1 billion in incremental annual revenue for PayPal within three years."" That would represent a significant increase, considering that PayPal's trailing-12-month revenue is currently less than $15 billion.PayPal has long been on the radar of fraudsters, and it's only natural that Venmo would eventually become a target. That said, PayPal has a long history of successfully dealing with threats of this sort. While the situation certainly bears watching, it doesn't appear to be anything more than business as usual.More From The Motley FoolDanny Vena owns shares of PayPal Holdings.

PYPL,11-30-2018 06:12PM,PayPal: Black Friday & Cyber Monday broke records with $1B+ in mobile payment volume,https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/30/paypal-black-friday-cyber-monday-broke-records-with-1b-in-mobile-payment-volume/?yptr=yahoo,"Black Friday broke records in terms of sales made from mobile devices, according to reports last week from Adobe. This week, PayPal said it saw a similar trend during the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday shopping event. PayPal saw a record-breaking $1 billion+ in mobile payment volume for the first time ever on Black Friday — a milestone it hit again on Cyber Monday.Mobile payment volume on Black Friday was up 42 percent over Black Friday 2017, the company said, and it even outpaced the mobile payment volume on Cyber Monday this year.However, Cyber Monday saw more total payment volume, likely because much of the shopping that takes place that day comes from office workers back at their desktops, wrapping up a few more purchases.Worldwide, mobile payment volume from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday accounted for a significant 43 percent of PayPal’s total payment volume. Between those days, PayPal was processing more than $25,000 per second, with more than $11,000 per second processed on mobile.The peak hour took place on Black Friday, which shows the sales event has shifted much of its business online. It’s now coming close to topping Cyber Monday in terms of both online and mobile shopping, PayPal noted.PayPal’s data also pointed to another trend: that of the blurring of the line as to when holiday shopping begins and ends. Many retailers these days are launching their deals on Thanksgiving or even earlier, then allowing them to run for the week of Black Friday or longer.Amazon, for example, has decided to capitalize on its own Black Friday/Cyber Monday momentum by launching a “12 Days of Deals” event that will feature hundreds of new deals every day from Sunday December 2 through Thursday December 13.Other times, the shopping starts early, as PayPal’s data shows. Thanksgiving has now become another major shopping day, the company said, having broken into the top 10 shopping days of the year. It also grew 41 percent over last year.E-commerce spending wasn’t the only thing that’s up year-over-year, PayPal also found. On Giving Tuesday — the event focused on donating to charities and other worthwhile causes — PayPal said more than a million customers from 180 markets donated $98 million this year. That’s a 51 percent increase from 2017, it said."
PYPL,11-30-2018 06:12PM,Ask a Fool: What Is the War on Cash?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ask-fool-war-cash-192912850.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The term ""war on cash"" refers to the general societal trend away from cash-based methods of payment in favor of card payments and other electronic forms of money transfer.Banks, merchants, governments, and other entities are all gradually shifting away from cash, and it's easy to see why. Cash is relatively easy to lose, can be expensive to secure and move, and in many situations, cash is simply not a convenient method of transferring money.From an investor's perspective, there are several types of businesses that stand to benefit from the gradual transition to a cashless society. Most obvious are payment-processing businesses like Visa, Mastercard, Square, PayPal, and others. The majority of payment transactions worldwide are still done in cash, so these companies still have a tremendous runway for growth.Banks are another potential beneficiary, especially when it comes to consumer adoption of mobile deposit and mobile payment technology. In fact, an electronic deposit or transfer costs a bank more than 10 times less than a similar teller-assisted transaction. Many banks also have large credit card businesses that could stand to benefit as well.In a nutshell, the amount of cash that is used for everyday purchases can be expected to decline over the coming decades, and some companies will get very rich from the transition.More From The Motley FoolMatthew Frankel, CFP owns shares of SQ.

It seemed like a lucrative growth strategy at the time, since investors were boosting the price of bitcoins to historic highs.However, the bubble subsequently popped, and bitcoins' price plunged about 80%. Will that meltdown hurt Square's core business of online payments and business services? Let's dig deeper into its fledgling bitcoin business to find out.Image source: Getty Images.Square's core hardware products and software services target business customers. Its main play on the consumer market is the Cash App, which is one of the top three peer-to-peer mobile payment apps in America, alongside Zelle and Paypal Holdings' (NASDAQ: PYPL) Venmo. Square also tethers users to that platform with a physical debit card called the Cash Card.The growth of the Cash App -- along with its Instant Deposit service, Caviar food delivery platform, and Square Capital financing arm -- supports the growth of Square's higher-margin subscription and services revenue, which surged 155% annually last quarter and accounted for 19% of its GAAP (generally accepted accounting principle) revenues.Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell estimates that Square's services could generate nearly half its revenues next year. The expansion of those services -- which also help companies manage payrolls, inventories, customer data, websites, and more -- would boost Square's revenues per customer, lock them into its ecosystem, and widen its moat against its rivals.Square's introduction of bitcoin transactions to the Cash App gave it a unique competitive edge against Venmo and Zelle, since neither rival app offered the feature. Bitcoin trades could also complement Square's upcoming moves into the personal finance space -- which could include savings accounts and stock trades for Cash users in the near future. Simply put, Square wants Cash to evolve into an all-in-one finance app for digital transactions -- and maintaining a foothold in the crypto market seems like a smart move.Image source: Getty Images.Square buys bitcoins for its Cash users, then adds a slight margin to the purchase price but doesn't charge additional transaction fees. Users are allowed to buy up to $10,000 in bitcoins per week, but there aren't any limits on selling.Square notably excludes its bitcoin- and transaction-based costs from its adjusted (non-GAAP) revenues. To calculate the profits Square generates from bitcoin sales, we simply subtract its bitcoin costs from its bitcoin revenues:Financial MetricQ1 2018Q2 2018Q3 2018Bitcoin revenues$34.10 million$37.02 million$42.96 millionBitcoin costs$33.87 million$36.60 million$42.41 millionBitcoin profits$223,000$420,000$555,000Source: Square quarterly reports.Square's bitcoin revenues accounted for just 5% of its GAAP revenues last quarter, and the profits accounted for only 3% of its GAAP profits (which turned positive after the Eventbrite (NYSE: EB) IPO earlier this year). Those percentages are low, but Square's bitcoin revenues and profits are still steadily climbing on a sequential basis -- even as bitcoins' market price crumbles.That's because Square merely acts as a bitcoin exchange instead of actually being invested in the cryptocurrency. In other words, more trades in a volatile market could boost Square's bitcoin revenues and profits more than a complacent one, regardless of the market price. Therefore, bitcoins' ongoing meltdown shouldn't have any impact on Square's long-term growth. In a worst-case scenario, Square would simply buy fewer bitcoins as its Cash users stop trading the cryptocurrency.Square CEO Jack Dorsey claimed that bitcoins could become the world's ""single currency"" in an interview with The Times of London earlier this year. However, Square's future isn't dependent on bitcoins -- it's merely using them as a way to widen Cash's moat against the bank network-backed Zelle and PayPal's Venmo. Cash's cumulative downloads surpassed Venmo's earlier this year, according to Sensor Tower and Nomura Instinet, which indicates that Square has a clear shot at hurting PayPal in the peer-to-peer payments space. There are certainly reasons to be cautious about Square's high-flying stock -- but tumbling bitcoin prices aren't one of them.More From The Motley FoolLeo Sun owns shares of Square.

PYPL,11-28-2018 06:12PM,The Pain for Facebook Stock Is Just Beginning,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pain-facebook-stock-just-beginning-184013828.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The lack of trust toward Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO and Chairman Mark Zuckerberg, combined with the increasing animus liberals bear toward Facebook, will likely ensure that FB stock will be lower in six months than it is now.In an article published on Oct. 25, I noted that Facebook had made multiple, alleged misstatements. I quoted Facebook’s VP, Business and Marketing Partnerships, David Fischer, as saying in 2016 that, “We know we can’t have true partnerships with our clients unless we are upfront and honest with them.”  I agreed, writing that FB had “jeopardized its relationships with … advertisers” by allegedly downplaying the degree to which it had exaggerated the amount of time spent watching videos on the website.Now more allegations of duplicity against Facebook, by a largely reputable, well-respected source, have surfaced. Specifically, on Nov. 14 The New York Times reported that in early 2017, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Zuckerberg’s No. 2, decided not to disclose Russia’s involvement with political advocacy on Facebook. According to the newspaper, FB kept a lid on the information “throughout the spring and summer of 2017.” When the company finally decided to disclose some information about the Russians’ activities, Sandberg ordered the disclosure to be “less specific,” The Times stated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis second major episode of dishonesty by Facebook will further undermine the ability of advertisers, regulators and consumers to trust the company. As a result, advertisers will be less likely to rely on the data they receive from Facebook, and they will be more likely to use other digital advertising options, hurting FB’s results and Facebook stock.Consumers will be less likely to share financial and highly personal information with Facebook, undermining the company’s attempts at direct sales and hurting its engagement numbers. Finally, government regulators will be less likely to trust the assurances they receive from FB, increasing the likelihood of governments using onerous regulations to rein in the company.Additionally, The Times reported that a lobbying firm hired by FB wrote “dozens of articles blasting Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for unsavory business practices.” The firm also sought to link opponents of Facebook to billionaire liberal activist George Soros, The Times stated. It seems that FB was trying to link its opponents to Soros in an effort to convince conservative activists and Republican lawmakers to side with Facebook.These tactics by Facebook will make other companies reluctant to work with the social networking giant, as they will fear that if FB doesn’t like something they do, it could smear them. For example, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) could avoid partnering with FB to enable money transfers over the Facebook website and/or WhatsApp.In a March 2018 article written shortly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, I warned that liberals could be upset at Facebook for helping Donald Trump to become President. The Times story increases the likelihood of that happening since it more clearly exposes the significant efforts by Russians to promote Trump on Facebook.Facebook’s alleged efforts to link its opponents to Soros, a liberal activist, could further upset liberals. As a result, liberals may curtail their use of Facebook. This trend could be exploited by existing competitors, especially Snap’s (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). And companies like Google, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) or even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could  be emboldened by the trend to launch their own competitors to Facebook. Of course, market share losses could negatively impact Facebook and FB stock significantly.There are many signs that the Street in general and investors in particular are losing confidence in the leadership of Zuckerberg and Sandberg, and consequently in Facebook stock. For example, two institutions that own Facebook stock — Arjuna Capital and Trillium Asset Management — recently called on Zuckerberg to relinquish the chairman role. And Michael Robinson of Money Map Press, described by Yahoo Finance as a “veteran tech analyst” recently told the platform that FB is “a deeply troubled stock,” adding that “I don’t know where the bottom is and I am not sure anybody really does.” And of course, FB stock has plunged over 35% from its July highs.Under the leadership of Zuckerberg and Sandberg, Facebook has probably lost the trust of many advertisers and regulators. It has also likely alienated many liberal users and investors. As a result, FB’s business is facing many threats and will probably deteriorate further, while FB stock will in all likelihood fall much further from its current levels.As of this writing, the author did not own shares of any of the companies named.Compare BrokersThe post The Pain for Facebook Stock Is Just Beginning appeared first on InvestorPlace."
PYPL,11-28-2018 06:12PM,Why Nio Stock Is Still Not Worth Your Money Despite Recent Strength,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nio-stock-still-not-145100739.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.If there were a word to describe Nio (NYSE:NIO) and NIO stock it would have to be “resilient.”In early October, I suggested seven stocks under $10 that you shouldn’t buy. Nio was one of them. Since then, it’s up more than 15%.At the time of my article in early October, I held out little hope for the electric vehicle company, that some are calling the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips“Nio wants to deliver a Tesla-like vehicle at a lower cost,” I wrote Oct. 3. “However, if experience making cars is important to you, you’ll want to avoid its stock.”If you’ve followed the progress of Tesla over the past five years, I’m not sure why you’d want to invest in Nio.The payoff for investors will take years, not months, if at all. With most of the big carmakers getting into electric vehicles, the competition is only going to intensify, something Tesla is more than prepared to face.“Tesla has already demonstrated its ability to outcompete incumbents and their internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles despite a higher price, as consumers are willing to pay a premium for a better product and not just a different powertrain technology,” said Berenberg Bank analyst Alexander Haissl in October.Tesla produced a profit in Q3 2018 of $2.90 a share — $1.84 a share or $314 million if you exclude $1.06 per share in regulatory credits — and it expects to do the same in the final quarter of 2018. This newfound profitability, which Tesla predicted, combined with the fact that Elon Musk’s vision appears to be gaining traction finally, and you have the makings of an excellent growth story.Nio, by comparison, has barely stepped off the curb.Nothing against the people behind Nio, but they don’t have Elon Musk’s visionary chops, and they certainly don’t have some of America’s bestselling vehicles, electric or otherwise.Regardless of Nio’s potential, InvestorPlace’s Vince Martin believes that the current market’s resistance to risk is no place for investors to be rolling the dice on the next great automotive/tech company.“This is a market that clearly is running from risk. Whether it’s trade war concerns, rising interest rates, or just profit-taking, equity investors are fleeing risk,” Martin wrote in mid-October.“There are few stocks more risky than a Chinese auto company valued at roughly 1,000x revenue. I’m not terribly interested in the NIO stock story, but more aggressive investors might be.”Vince is right about Nio. Only the most speculative investors should consider owning its stock in 2018.My InvestorPlace colleague, Josh Enomoto, recently made an excellent point about Nio’s lack of brand recognition outside China and the time it could take to gain the trust of consumers.“The most-worrisome headwind is time. The automaker simply hasn’t put in the time to become a renowned brand outside of China. This could take a lot longer than investors may realize,” Josh wrote Nov. 14.“For example, American drivers today are familiar with Asian car manufacturers like Hyundai or Kia. But it took decades of trial and error and experimenting with customer incentives before these companies became household names.”Tesla had an advantage.It had Elon Musk. A name already familiar to investors because of his time spent at Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL). However, even with that, Musk’s spent 14 years working on Tesla; it’s not exactly an overnight success.Nio might have excellent technology, and its stock has been incredibly resilient in a very tough market, but I fail to see how it will survive 14 years of pain as Tesla has.As stocks go, NIO stock is not worth your time.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare BrokersThe post Why Nio Stock Is Still Not Worth Your Money Despite Recent Strength appeared first on InvestorPlace."
PYPL,11-28-2018 06:12PM,"As the famous 'FAANG' trade falters, these five tech stocks are the new favorites of top analysts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/famous-apos-faang-apos-trade-152500816.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The so-called FAANG stocks are still looking pretty precarious right now. In the last three months, both Facebook and Apple have plunged over 20 percent. Amazon and Netflix haven't fared much better, and even the relatively-stable Alphabet is trading down 15 percent.So let's look past FAANG stocks for a moment. There are plenty of other compelling technology plays out there.TipRanks' Stock Screener searched for tech sector stocks with a strong buy consensus from the Street's best-performing analysts over the last three months. The Street is bullish on the following five tech names — and not one of them starts with F, A, N or G.MicrosoftSoftware giant Microsoft MSFT is one of the Street's clear tech favorites right now. Out of 19 top analysts polled in the last three months, 18 had a bullish sentiment on the stock. Only one analyst, Jefferies' John Difucci, has a sell rating. Meanwhile the $125 average analyst price target indicates compelling upside potential of over 17 percent.KeyBanc's Brent Bracelin ( Track Record & Ratings ) cited Microsoft's fast-growing cloud and internet businesses that could top $70 billion in revenue by 2020, up from $18.5 billion in 2016. ""We would continue to Overweight MSFT shares on a multiyear model transformation driven by fast-growing cloud and internet segments,"" he wrote on Oct. 24.He boosted his price target to $125 from $123, citing Microsoft's impressive $1.2 billion revenue beat for the first quarter 2019. This marked the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for the world's largest software maker. Meanwhile improving margins across all three main segments (office products and cloud growth, server products and cloud growth, and gaming) contributed to an easy 18 cent EPS beat.Bracelin joins several other analysts who are growing increasingly bullish on Microsoft. Oppenheimer's Timothy Horan called the quarter a ""knockout"" while Bank of America's Kash Rangan described Microsoft's growth as ""phenomenal.""PayPalAnalysts see a strong buying opportunity in payments stock PayPal PYPL . Since the beginning of the week, three analysts have reiterated their PayPal buy ratings.These analysts are sticking to their bullish calls despite a Wall Street Journal report suggesting PayPal experienced unexpectedly high fraud losses with its Venmo digital money transfer service.""While the WSJ story on unexpected fraud losses is a bit unsettling, we think it is more surprising that the information became public,"" Buckingham analyst Chris Brendler ( Track Record & Ratings ) wrote on Nov. 26. ""Innovative payments companies are constantly testing and learning new products/features so we're more concerned how/why this story came public.""Five-star Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Joseph Foresi ( Track Record & Ratings ) sets out the bull picture in his Oct. 23 report. He pointed to its higher-than-industry growth rate and dominant position in online payment processing. ""Fundamentally, we believe PayPal can grow at roughly double the market average, supporting its premium to the group.""He reiterated his PYPL buy rating with a price target of $101, 23 percent above its current price.In total, this strong buy stock has snapped up 19 top analyst buy ratings versus four hold ratings over the last three months. This is with a $100 average analyst price target.VMwareVMware VMW , the cloud computing subsidiary of Dell, is the leading provider of virtualization solutions for businesses. Shares are already up 21 percent year-to-date. And according to the Street, plenty of upside potential still lies ahead.This is a strong buy tech stock with six recent buy ratings and one hold rating. Meanwhile the average top analyst price target of $180 translates into upside potential of over 18 percent.Analysts approve of VMware's acquisition of Heptio, announced earlier this month. Terms of the detail were not disclosed, but the startup had been valued at $117 million by PitchBook back in 2017.With Heptio, VMW can boost its offerings for the open-source system Kubernetes. Two of the three creators of Kubernetes went on to found Heptio and will now join the VMware team.For Jefferies' analyst John DiFucci ( Track Record & Ratings ), the deal is a savvy move, as it ""fits squarely into the company's broader Software-Defined Data Center strategy."" He keeps a buy rating on the shares with a $186 price target, representing 22 percent upside.T-MobileKeep a close eye on T-Mobile TMUS , whether or not the Sprint deal goes ahead. The proposed $26 billion merger could close by as early as the first quarter 2019, though the second quarter remains more likely.""T-Mobile is the third-largest wireless carrier in the US, capturing 100% of the industry growth since 2013"" writes five-star Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan ( Track Record & Ratings ). He places the share gains down to a greatly improved network coupled with innovative marketing to underserved urban and rural communities.Plus Horan sees the Sprint merger substantially increasing the companies' pro forma value through $6 billion in synergies. ""We continue to believe a combined TMUS/S can greatly improve network quality and match VZ's firm value, which could mean a 2-3x increase in the stock in five years"" the analyst says.With this in mind, Horan reiterated his T-Mobile buy rating on Nov. 5 with a Street-high $90 price target, which is 33 percent above the current price.In total, five out of six top-ranked analysts are bullish on the strong buy stock.SalesforceSalesforce CRM calls itself the world's No. 1 customer relationship management platform. Right now, the stock is buzzing following the release of strong earnings results that beat expectations.Business remained very solid in the third quarter, with total revenue of $3.39 billion up 26 percent year-over-year. And while guidance for the fourth quarter came in mixed, Salesforce gave very encouraging guidance for both 2019 and 2020.""We see salesforce.com's F3Q results and improved outlook supporting our bull thesis on the customer engagement opportunity"" writes top Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz ( Track Record & Ratings ). He reiterated his buy rating on Nov. 28 with a $180 price target (40 percent upside potential).An economic slowdown could hamper software sales, but companies are still expected to make it a top spending priority next year, ""and this causes us to favor CRM in large-cap technology,"" the analyst wrote.Overall, Salesforce has a very positive Street rating right now. Out of 30 analysts rating the stock, 28 are bullish with only two analysts staying on the sidelines. The $173 average analyst price target translates into 36 percent upside potential from current levels.More From CNBC"
PYPL,11-28-2018 06:12PM,Amazon Pay Is Growing Fast -- Should PayPal and Apple Pay Be Worried?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-pay-growing-fast-paypal-142016644.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Although it's been around for some time, Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) digital wallet, Amazon Pay, is just starting to surge in popularity on merchant websites. While Industry Focus: Financials host Jason Moser believes PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Pay have clear technological advantages, Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel, CFP, thinks that Amazon's familiarity gives it an advantage as more consumers adopt digital wallets in the coming years.A full transcript follows the video.More From The Motley FoolThis video was recorded on Nov. 26, 2018.Jason Moser: Let's kick right off here talking about Amazon. There are a few different points to this discussion we want to get to. We're talking primarily about Amazon's effort to gain more share in the payments space. That's through Amazon Pay. We can couple this discussion also with the fact that according to Adobe Analytics, Black Friday pulled in a record $6.22 billion in online sales, which was up almost 24% from a year ago. It was the first day in history to see more than $2 billion in sales stemming from smartphones. That's where I really want to pick this conversation up here. Not only are we living in an e-commerce world, we're certainly living in a mobile world, as well.For a lot of us, Amazon Pay probably isn't top of mind, yet we're reading now that they're really making efforts to gain share, it seems like initially with companies that are not necessarily direct competitors, like gas stations or restaurants or what have you. It does seem like they're trying to take a little bit more of that role in the transaction, much like we've seen Apple do to date with Apple Pay. But it's also not just Apple. There are all these payments companies out there, trying to get a little piece of that transaction.Talk a little bit about your experience with Amazon Pay. Give us a little bit of your perspective here as to what the endgame is with Amazon.Matt Frankel: I was on a certain retailer's website. I can't tell you what I bought, or who I bought it from, because it was an anniversary gift for my wife, who listens to the show.Moser: Oh, so you really can't. I was going to say, ""You can't, or you won't?"" But it's both.Frankel: I really can't. It was a small business, something you would see featured on Shark Tank. It struck me as somewhere that gets most of their sales from Amazon to begin with. This was directly on their website. I went to check out, they were having a great Black Friday sale. I went to their website, selected my products, and went to the checkout. And there were two buttons. There was a PayPal button and an Amazon Pay button. I was curious, because I had never seen that on a merchant's website. Amazon really hasn't pushed it until recently. So, I clicked Amazon Pay, and it took me right to my Amazon checkout, where I have my Amazon credit card already set up. It was just like checking out for a normal Amazon purchase. It took me about two clicks. It was very easy. I was actually going to use PayPal, and I like this alternative because it lets me keep all my purchases in one place. I'd say about 50% of what my wife and I order is already through Amazon. It lets me organize my purchases into one payment portal. I actually think PayPal might have something to worry about here.Moser: That's a good perspective there. I want to ask you, the initial thing that comes to mind here where I think they may have a little bit of a challenge, we know that to date, the U.S. consumer isn't necessarily all that digital-wallet-focused yet. That's still something that we're in the very nascent stages of, and I think it's going to take a while for that behavior to really change. You look at something like Apple Pay, for example, as clever as that is, consumers still aren't embracing that wholeheartedly. Whether it's Apple Pay or Google Pay or Amazon Pay, the digital wallet, there's a big opportunity there. That explains why Amazon is pursuing this.The one hang-up here I have with Amazon and the process that you just described, it sounds like there's a little bit more friction in there vs. if I go somewhere, whatever website it may be, and I have the option to pay with Apple Pay. When it says, ""Do you want to use Apple Pay?"" And you can just use your thumbprint to verify the transaction, as opposed to having to go to another website and verify that purchase. What I'm getting at here is ultimately, it feels like Apple, and to a degree Google, have a hardware advantage that Amazon doesn't have to date. Does that make sense?Frankel: Yes, but here's my perspective on that. I don't necessarily think this will steal any market share from people who are already on Apple Pay or PayPal. Both of those are, like you said, very easy portals. They both have hardware advantages over Amazon. But there are a lot of people who are not using digital wallets yet who are already comfortable with Amazon's checkout process. I don't necessarily think they're going to steal market share or steal existing customers from any of the other ones, but I do think it gives them an advantage recruiting new adopters to digital wallets.Moser: Probably, you're right. We talk about this all the time, this is not a zero-sum game. It's not as if one wins and everybody else loses. This is a massive opportunity out there. At the end of the day, money is going everywhere. That's what dictates everything, basically, is money getting from point A to point B. Pursuing even just a small piece of that pie makes a lot of sense, particularly in Amazon's case, because really, you have to figure for them, this is a very easy bet to make. The business certainly isn't hinging on it. At the most, they get a tiny scrape of that transaction. When Apple Pay is used, Apple gets a very, very tiny scrape of that transaction. It's not terribly meaningful. It becomes meaningful if you have a billion people using it on a consistent basis. And obviously, we're not to that point yet. But even beyond the financial implications, I would imagine that a company like Amazon, as smart as they are about using data and doing things with that data, just gleaning the data from transactions like these would be seen as a reasonable pay-off.Frankel: Right, and that seems to really be what they're after here. I've actually read that Amazon is subsidizing the swipe fees for merchants -- not swipe fees, but whatever the swipe-fee-equivalent of digital wallet fees are. They're actually subsidizing the fees to get retailers to put the Amazon Pay button on their website at a lower cost to them. It's fair to say Amazon's not making money on this, but it's expanding their reach. Anything that expands Amazon's reach, data-wise, customer-wise, merchant-wise, is good for the long-term business.Moser: Makes sense to me. I don't think Amazon's going to ever going to have a hardware advantage at least on the smartphone side. They tried with the Fire phone. They were late to the game, tried to do something a little bit different, but there was nothing terribly compelling to get someone to switch, particularly if you're already used to a certain operating system. I'm also skeptical when it comes to incorporating things like voice assistant technology into actually paying for things.With all that said, things change very quickly. Technology is evolving seemingly on a daily basis. I'm going to be interested to see where Amazon takes this. Amazon Pay has been around for a while, they just haven't done much with it. Perhaps we're entering this stage now where consumers are going to be a bit more open to adopting digital payments and digital wallets and whatnot. If that's the case, clearly we can see there's a lot of market share there to pick up. For Amazon to try to be a part of that makes perfect sense.Frankel: To be perfectly clear, PayPal, Amazon Pay, and Apple Pay all have tremendous growth runways. PayPal's growth rate could go from 20% to 19%. I'm not saying they're going to really suffer. To be clear, I still love PayPal on a long-term basis.Moser: Gotcha! We want to make sure we respond to the inevitable email we're going to get. We're not saying, ""Short PayPal, long Amazon."" You're probably saying go long on both, right? It's reasonable to just diversify your portfolio, own shares in both companies.Frankel: Right. Both companies are going to be winners. I could just see the tweetstorm going off in my head when I was saying that.Moser: Well, we'll get out in front of it if that does happen.John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

PYPL,11-27-2018 06:12PM,"Small-Cap Banks, Amazon Pay, and More",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-cap-banks-amazon-pay-230000585.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.We spend a lot of time covering the big banks, so here's a closer look at four small-cap bank stocks that probably aren't on your radar -- yet. Plus, host Jason Moser and Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel, CFP, discuss Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon Pay and what it could mean to some of our War on Cash favorites. Plus, the team answers listener emails on REITs, bank interest margins, dividends and buybacks, and more. It's all on this week's episode of Industry Focus: Financials.A full transcript follows the video.More From The Motley FoolThis video was recorded on Nov. 26, 2018.Jason Moser: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market each day. It's Monday, Nov. 26. I'm your host, Jason Moser. On today's show, we're going to talk small-cap financial stocks. We'll tackle some listener emails. We'll tap into Twitter, of course, and give you One to Watch for the coming week.But we begin this week talking about the king of e-commerce as Amazon continues to pursue the massive market opportunity not only in e-commerce but out there in payments. We talk a lot about payments here, as you know. Joining me in the studio this week, as usual, is Certified Financial Planner Matt Frankel. Matt, how's everything going?Matt Frankel: Pretty good. We took the kids up to my family in Maryland and just got back from that. I actually had a chance to use Amazon Pay for some Black Friday shopping last. I'm really looking forward to talking about that.Moser: I have a feeling we're going to be digging into that a little bit. You guys had a nice Thanksgiving weekend, it sounds like.Frankel: We did. The trip was surprisingly smooth for a 10-hour car ride with two small children.Moser: Holy cow, 10 hours! How many times did you have to stop for that trip?Frankel: We've got little kids, one of whom is potty training, so...Moser: Well, we're glad to have you back here and joining us. You mentioned Amazon Pay, so let's kick right off here talking about Amazon. There are a few different points to this discussion we want to get to. We're talking primarily about Amazon's effort to gain more share in the payments space. That's through Amazon Pay. We can couple this discussion also with the fact that according to Adobe Analytics, Black Friday pulled in a record $6.22 billion in online sales, which was up almost 24% from a year ago. It was the first day in history to see more than $2 billion in sales stemming from smartphones. That's where I really want to pick this conversation up here. Not only are we living in an e-commerce world; we're certainly living in a mobile world as well.For a lot of us, Amazon Pay probably isn't top of mind, yet we're reading now that they're really making efforts to gain share, it seems like initially with companies that are not necessarily direct competitors, like gas stations or restaurants or what have you. It does seem like they're trying to take a little bit more of that role in the transaction, much like we've seen Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) do to date with Apple Pay. But it's also not just Apple. There are all these payments companies out there, trying to get a little piece of that transaction.Talk a little bit about your experience with Amazon Pay. Give us a little bit of your perspective here as to what the endgame is with Amazon.Frankel: I was on a certain retailer's website. I can't tell you what I bought, or who I bought it from, because it was an anniversary gift for my wife, who listens to the show.Moser: Oh, so you really can't. I was going to say, ""You can't, or you won't?"" But it's both.Frankel: I really can't. It was a small business, something you would see featured on Shark Tank. It struck me as somewhere that gets most of their sales from Amazon to begin with. This was directly on their website. I went to check out; they were having a great Black Friday sale. I went to their website, selected my products, and went to the checkout. And there were two buttons. There was a PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) button and an Amazon Pay button. I was curious, because I had never seen that on a merchant's website. Amazon really hasn't pushed it until recently. So I clicked Amazon Pay, and it took me right to my Amazon checkout, where I have my Amazon credit card already set up. It was just like checking out for a normal Amazon purchase. It took me about two clicks. It was very easy. I was actually going to use PayPal, and I like this alternative because it lets me keep all my purchases in one place. I'd say about 50% of what my wife and I order is already through Amazon. It lets me organize my purchases into one payment portal. I actually think PayPal might have something to worry about here.Moser: That's a good perspective there. I want to ask you, the initial thing that comes to mind here where I think they may have a little bit of a challenge, we know that to date, the U.S. consumer isn't necessarily all that digital-wallet-focused yet. That's still something that we're in the very nascent stages of, and I think it's going to take a while for that behavior to really change. You look at something like Apple Pay, for example, as clever as that is, consumers still aren't embracing that wholeheartedly. Whether it's Apple Pay or Google Pay or Amazon Pay, the digital wallet, there's a big opportunity there. That explains why Amazon is pursuing this.The one hang-up here I have with Amazon and the process that you just described, it sounds like there's a little bit more friction in there, versus if I go somewhere, whatever website it may be, and I have the option to pay with Apple Pay. When it says, ""Do you want to use Apple Pay?"" And you can just use your thumbprint to verify the transaction, as opposed to having to go to another website and verify that purchase. What I'm getting at here is ultimately, it feels like Apple, and to a degree Google, have a hardware advantage that Amazon doesn't have to date. Does that make sense?Frankel: Yes, but here's my perspective on that. I don't necessarily think this will steal any market share from people who are already on Apple Pay or PayPal. Both of those are, like you said, very easy portals. They both have hardware advantages over Amazon. But there are a lot of people who are not using digital wallets yet who are already comfortable with Amazon's checkout process. I don't necessarily think they're going to steal market share or steal existing customers from any of the other ones, but I do think it gives them an advantage recruiting new adopters to digital wallets.Moser: Probably, you're right. We talk about this all the time, this is not a zero-sum game. It's not as if one wins and everybody else loses. This is a massive opportunity out there. At the end of the day, money is going everywhere. That's what dictates everything, basically, is money getting from Point A to Point B. Pursuing even just a small piece of that pie makes a lot of sense, particularly in Amazon's case, because really, you have to figure for them, this is a very easy bet to make. The business certainly isn't hinging on it. At the most, they get a tiny scrape of that transaction. When Apple Pay is used, Apple gets a very, very tiny scrape of that transaction. It's not terribly meaningful. It becomes meaningful if you have a billion people using it on a consistent basis. And obviously, we're not to that point yet. But even beyond the financial implications, I would imagine that a company like Amazon, as smart as they are about using data and doing things with that data, just gleaning the data from transactions like these would be seen as a reasonable pay-off.Frankel: Right, and that seems to really be what they're after here. I've actually read that Amazon is subsidizing the swipe fees for merchants -- not swipe fees, but whatever the swipe-fee-equivalent of digital wallet fees are. They're actually subsidizing the fees to get retailers to put the Amazon Pay button on their website at a lower cost to them. It's fair to say Amazon's not making money on this, but it's expanding their reach. Anything that expands Amazon's reach, data-wise, customer-wise, merchant-wise, is good for the long-term business.Moser: Makes sense to me. I don't think Amazon's going to ever going to have a hardware advantage, at least on the smartphone side. They tried with the Fire Phone. They were late to the game, tried to do something a little bit different, but there was nothing terribly compelling to get someone to switch, particularly if you're already used to a certain operating system. I'm also skeptical when it comes to incorporating things like voice assistant technology into actually paying for things.With all that said, things change very quickly. Technology is evolving seemingly on a daily basis. I'm going to be interested to see where Amazon takes this. Amazon Pay has been around for a while, they just haven't done much with it. Perhaps we're entering this stage now where consumers are going to be a bit more open to adopting digital payments and digital wallets and whatnot. If that's the case, clearly we can see there's a lot of market share there to pick up. For Amazon to try to be a part of that makes perfect sense.Frankel: To be perfectly clear, PayPal, Amazon Pay, and Apple Pay all have tremendous growth runways. PayPal's growth rate could go from 20% to 19%. I'm not saying they're going to really suffer. To be clear, I still love PayPal on a long-term basis.Moser: Gotcha! We want to make sure we respond to the inevitable email we're going to get. We're not saying, ""Short PayPal, long Amazon."" You're probably saying go long on both, right? It's reasonable to just diversify your portfolio, own shares in both companies.Frankel: Right. Both companies are going to be winners. I could just see the tweetstorm going off in my head when I was saying that.Moser: Well, we'll get out in front of it if that does happen. Let's take a look here, new topic for discussion. We got a tweet a few days back from @ChrisM_Jones. Chris said, ""Would love for the two of you to cover some small-cap financials. For example, AX, UVE. Full disclosure: UVE was my first stock, and now is my largest position."" The bottom line is, Chris was hoping we could take a look into some more small-cap financial stocks.Matt, you and I love talking stocks. When you get to find compelling small-cap financials, we could probably talk about that for the next four hours. Unfortunately, we're not going to be given that much time. We thought we would take an opportunity here to target two companies each in the small-cap space that we like and see if we could give Chris a couple of ideas, companies that we like, some things to keep an eye on with them.We're going to start the discussion here with a company that Matt, you know, Synovus (NYSE: SNV), ticker SNV. Give us your elevator pitch for Synovus.Frankel: This is a bank that I drive by a lot, because it's a Southern regional bank. The reason I like Synovus is, one, they're profitable; two, they're growing very fast. On the side of profitability, return on assets of a little over 1.3, return on equity of 40%. Both are great numbers. The loan portfolio is growing at a pretty impressive rate, about 4.5% a year. They're making acquisitions on a pretty aggressive basis, and they're actually getting really good deals.I reported over the summer that Synovus decided to acquire a bank called FCB Financial, Florida Community Bank. They actually wound up getting a discount to the share price. Generally, when you acquire a company, you're paying a premium. That's why the shares jump up right after the acquisition's announced. This will make them one of the biggest regional banks around. They got a great price. They expect it to be immediately accretive to earnings. I really like Synovus. Very profitable, well-run bank with big ambitions.Moser: Ameris Bancorp (NASDAQ: ABCB) is the first one I'm going to talk about here. Listeners have probably heard me talk about it before. The ticker is ABCB. This is a not-so-little regional bank in the Southeast. Home base is Moultrie, Georgia. Full disclosure: My mom and dad actually live in Moultrie, Georgia. I've played golf with a couple of these guys at Ameris Bancorp before. That wasn't through design; it's just small-town living there. Everybody knows everybody. And I do own shares of Ameris Bancorp as well. This is a company I found back in 2011, at the depths of the financial crisis, when a lot of these small-cap banks, these tiny banks, particularly in Georgia, for whatever reason, were going belly-up. They had bad loan books and really overextended themselves. Ameris Bancorp has always been a very well-run, fairly conservative operation, not trying to write checks that the bank can't cash.What that resulted in, over the course of the few years in that recovery from the financial crisis, the FDIC recognized Ameris Bancorp's excellence in operating and started using Ameris as a partner in rolling up some of these failed financial institutions to give them at least a little bit of an exit strategy so that everything didn't go completely to hell in a handbasket. What this ultimately did for Ameris, it gave them a very risk-free way to build up their asset base and their deposit base. The FDIC basically said, ""Any losses are going to be on us. We just want you to help us get these things rolled up, and there's going to be nothing ultimately but upside there for you.""Fast-forward to today, that really has worked out for the company. They now have total assets near close to $11.5 billion. Tangible book value per share is close to $18. All in all, what you have here in Ameris is a still small-cap bank, around $2 billion market cap, that has grown its presence beyond that Georgia footprint. They have plenty of opportunities to continue to make some smart acquisitions going forward. And they certainly have done that. They recently purchased Atlantic Coast Financial, as well as Hamilton State Bank. It's all helping them grow this business out. Longtime CEO Edwin Hortman stepped down recently. The new CEO, Dennis Zember, who has been with the company for a number of years, held positions of COO and CFO.That's all to say, I expect that conservative, smart, long-term-focused mentality to continue here with Ameris Bancorp. Certainly had developed a long track record of success. I suspect we will see that going forward as well. That's one of those little small-cap financials I really like.Speaking of banks, Matt, you wanted to take a trip out west and talk a little bit about Bank of Hawaii (NYSE: BOH), right?Frankel: Yeah! Since we're talking about some of your disclosures, disclosure: I've never been to Hawaii, so I've never been to a Bank of Hawaii branch.Moser: I've been to Hawaii! I was looking to see if we could get a Fool branch in Hawaii. That'd be pretty sweet, actually.Frankel: If there was an office there, I might sign up for it.Moser: I was pitching that and/or the Bahamas. I would gladly take either post.Frankel: [laughs] So I've never actually been to a Bank of Hawaii, but I know a lot about them as a bank. They're one of my favorite small-cap banks. I've been watching them for a little while. Not only are they an extremely profitable bank, but along with one other bank, they have a pretty dominant market share in Hawaii. If you're in Hawaii, you generally don't go to a Bank of America or Wells Fargo. You're either at Bank of Hawaii or First Hawaiian Bank, the other major bank out there. They have a very big market share. Great reputation on the island. Don't expect too much growth as in geographic growth. You're not going to have a Bank of Hawaii branch in Kansas or anything like that.Hawaii's economy is doing great. It's growing at a faster rate than the rest of the U.S. It's one of the fastest-growing economies. Great reputation. The loan portfolio, for example, grew about 7% over the past year, most banks were in the 3%-4% range, if you look back at our episode where we covered the big banks. That's a testament to how strong the Hawaiian economy is right now. Consistently profitable throughout any economy.A little fun fact: After Citigroup almost collapsed during the financial crisis, they brought in Bank of Hawaii's former CEO to be the new chairman of the board. The big guys on Wall Street know how profitable Bank of Hawaii is and how well run it is.It's not a cheap bank stock. I put it in the valuation category of a US Bancorp. But just like Synovus, about a 1.3% return on assets, and 18% return on equity, which is unheard of for a brick-and-mortar bank. Highly profitable. Very, very low default rate. It was like a 0.2% non-performing assets rate, which is extremely low. Great economy, great quality bank, great history of being a well-run institution. That's why it's one of my favorites. Hopefully I get to visit one someday.Moser: I feel like this is the opportunity to bring this thing under official coverage here at the Fool. The annual meeting is out there in Hawaii, right? That has to be where they have the annual meetings. Then you have to go out there, right? It's the biggest no-brainer. We'll look into that later this week, Matt.Let's wrap it up here. Chris had made specific mention here of a company, Universal Insurance Holdings. This is the company he said has grown into his biggest position. Let me tell you, Chris, I think that's not actually such a bad move here. From what I have seen with Universal Insurance Holdings, this is a pretty compelling company. This is the largest private personal residential homeowner's insurance company in Florida. When I say Florida, let's be very clear, most of their business is in Florida. Only 26% of their total insured business is outside of Florida. This is a Florida play. They are in 16 states, but right now, this is a Florida play. They are seeking to expand that footprint and diversify, geographically speaking.But generally speaking, we love the insurance business from the investor's perspective, because insurance is one of those things that's always going to be needed, particularly if you're a homeowner. Chances are, you've got a mortgage, you have to pay that mortgage, your mortgage company is going to require it. Even if you've got your mortgage paid off, nobody owns a home and isn't going to have some type of insurance on it.Universal Insurance Holdings has been focusing on its primary market of Florida for a number of years. It's a small company, $1.5 billion market cap. But I tell you, if you bought this thing five years ago, you're feeling really good about it. The stock's up close to 300% since then. A big measure for us when we look at insurance companies is book value. We can see through Universal's book value they are growing. In 2013, that book value was at $5.20 per share, vs. today, which is $15.20 per share. Obviously, that indicates the company is growing, and growing at a healthy rate. Another metric that we look to with insurance companies to understand if they're writing good books of business is the combined ratio. We like to see that combined ratio under 100%, that tells us that they are writing good business, profitable business. The combined ratio for Universal in 2017 chalked up at 84.4%. That actually was a little bit up historically from what we've seen in years past.This is a well-run business. CEO Sean Downes has been there for a while, has plenty of experience in the industry. The risks with a business like this, particularly in a state like this, is the natural disasters. Florida is known for its storms. But the flip side of that is, every insurance company in Florida is planning for that stuff. It's not a matter of if; it's a matter of when. So I like to believe that management is certainly keeping that on their radar. And the way that insurance companies tend to hedge that risk is by reinsurance.So all in all, it does look like Universal Insurance Holdings is doing a lot of good things with the business. Based on the metrics, the business looks very healthy. Strong balance sheet, appears to be very capable management there. Chris, I think you can feel pretty good about owning that one. Congratulations on your gains, and here's to many, many more dollars in the future!Chris, thank you for the question! We always love taking a look at new stocks, and this gave us a chance to dig into a few new names, and hopefully give our listeners a few additional ideas for their watchlist.OK, Matt, let's take a look at some email questions we've pulled in over the past couple of weeks. We had a question from Jay Otto in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He says, ""I love your podcast. I enjoy listening to you on the other podcasts as well."" Thanks, Jay! I like being on those podcasts. I think he's talking about me, Matt, but I'm not sure. He had a question on REITs. I'm going to give you this question, Matt, because you're our REIT guy. ""Is there any difference in investing in REIT stocks versus other equities? I think I've heard in the past that there are different tax implications with these stocks. Is that true?""Frankel: Yes, that is absolutely true. Provided that you hold them in a taxable account, most dividend stocks have what are called qualified dividend status, which gets favorable tax treatment. Think long-term capital gains rates, the same rates that apply to qualified dividends. Generally, most people pay a 15% dividend tax rate if you're in any of the middle tax brackets. If you have a REIT, though, it's considered pass-through business income for the most part, so you're generally taxed at your ordinary income tax rate for a REIT.There are a couple of caveats to mention. One: Your REIT dividend is actually a combination of a qualified dividend and a non-qualified dividend. Depending on the quarter and the particular REIT, most of it is usually ordinary income with a little bit that you'll get a favorable tax treatment on. The second thing is that thanks to the tax reform bill, REITs qualify for that pass-through deduction as small business income. Whatever income you do get from REITs, you can take a 20% deduction for that before your ordinary income tax rates are applied.There's a lot of moving parts here. The situation is definitely a little more complicated with REITs than it is for other stocks. But I love them. I always recommend REITs in retirement accounts so you don't have to worry about this. But yes, if you hold them in a regular brokerage account, there's a big tax differences. Long story short, REITs are a little more complicated.Moser: Good information to know. Jay has a follow-up as well. ""Another topic you hit on last week was Buffett's large investments in the big banks in the last quarter. You guys talked about how it should be a good environment for the big banks with rising interest rates. Can I assume the same opportunity is there for smaller banks such as Axos or,"" a bank we just talked about a minute ago, ""Ameris Bancorp?""Frankel: The opportunity is definitely there. You have to remember that certain banking products are tied to short-term interest rates and some are tied to long-term interest rates. For example, if a bank is a big credit card business, credit card rates go up immediately when the Fed raises rates. Those businesses are already seeing a big benefit, as the Fed has hiked rates about eight times so far in this cycle. On the other hand, if you don't have a big credit card operation and you rely on long-term rates, such as mortgages and auto loans, those really haven't kept pace with the shorter end of the spectrum. It depends which end of the yield curve is moving as to which banks benefit the most. It's not really small cap versus large cap; it's how is their loan portfolio made up? Short-term loans like credit cards or long-term loans like mortgages and auto loans that are not at variable rates that move with longer-term Treasury yields, not the federal funds rate.The short answer to your question is yes, but look into how the bank makes its money. That'll tell you what rates need to rise.Moser: That's a great point! We have one more question, from Landon Boring. Landon, come on, man, you're not boring. [laughs] Just kidding! Landon says, ""I really enjoy the Industry Focus podcasts."" Thanks, Landon. We enjoy doing them! ""I have a question about the War on Cash podcast from Nov. 19, 2018. Jason and Matt mentioned that they like the buybacks of Visa but are OK with small dividends to fund future growth. I'm confused. Don't both buybacks and dividends decrease the amount of cash to fund future growth?"" He goes on to say he would personally prefer dividends over buybacks. That's cash in the pocket. But on the other hand, increasing dividends generally represents a much stronger commitment by management in the faith of the business, because companies generally do not like to cut the dividend, and dividends provide a more direct reward to shareholders.Landon, you make a very good point here. Regardless of whether it's a dividend or a buyback, the company has to fund that one way or another. When you have a business like Visa, or Mastercard for that matter, that is as big as they are, and have very high-margin business models, as they both do, the nice thing about that type of investment opportunity for investors is that while the growth is going to be there, the growth will generally be organic, and it'll be tied to general consumer spending. These are business models that generate a lot of surplus cash. They have to do something with it. There's only so much they can reinvest in the business before they start getting a little bit outside of their circle of competence, and you start seeing some deteriorating returns on those investments. So you reward your shareholders either through a dividend or share repurchases.I tend to prefer dividends, just because, like you said, Landon, they are cash in the pocket. But by the same token, these companies do know that material buybacks over the course of time can play out on the share price. The fact of the matter is, when you reduce that number of shares outstanding, that's going to give you a little bit of a different look on the value of those shares. It should, in theory, make them a little bit more expensive over time.All in all, we like to see a healthy mix there, and feel like, with Visa and Mastercard, perhaps the opportunity there is to grow that dividend a little bit more substantially over time. That's what we'll be hoping that they do. Landon, thank you very much for the question! Jay, you as well!We'll tap into Twitter here really quick for a couple of comments. One from @Cricket99238. Neeraj says he was delighted to learn about the XLF Holdings SPDR ETF for financials. ""Thanks for introducing it. And with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) and [JPMorgan Chase] as its largest holding, it seems a no-brainer investment. The market is certainly giving a wonderful opportunity to buy this stock basket."" Matt, that fund is what you were talking about a couple of weeks ago, right?Frankel: That's correct. It's basically if you don't want to put all your money in one bank stock -- it's not practical for most people listening to own 10 bank stocks like Warren Buffett does. If you're not comfortable owning an individual bank, you're not really sure which ones are healthy, which ones are not healthy, which ones are growing in the right way, which ones are growing in the wrong way, things like that, an index fund like the XLF, especially one like that that has very low fees, can be a great way to get exposure to the whole sector, if it does as well as Warren Buffett thinks it's going to.Moser: Good deal. We also have a tweet from @BuckyCat. BuckyCat wonders if buying Eventbrite (NYSE: EB) stock gives you a discount on buying tickets from them, because they buy a lot of event tickets from them between Eventbrite and Ticketfly. Listeners may remember that Eventbrite was my One to Watch last week. A little bit of a direction away from direct payments companies, but the relationship with payments companies in the space. Generally speaking, the company itself, I think, has a lot of opportunities for investors. BuckyCat, I don't know if you get discounts there. That would be pretty sweet. But it's good to know that you're buying a lot of tickets from them. I own Eventbrite shares, and that, in all honesty, should mean their share price should be going up in the future, if you keep on buying all those tickets.Frankel: A lot of people would own a lot more stocks if they would offer discounts. A lot more people would buy things like Fitbit stock. Berkshire Hathaway is the only one I know of that gives discounts to shareholders through all of its subsidiaries.Moser: That would be pretty sweet, if that was a more consistent behavior. Offer the shareholders a discount. I would utilize that all the time.Frankel: If you're a Berkshire shareholder, you can get a discount on Geico auto insurance. I don't know if you knew that.Moser: That's a good point there. If you go to the Berkshire meeting, there's all sorts of opportunities to buy the stuff that from the companies that they own, particularly See's Candies.

We're going to wrap things up with our one to watch. What is the stock that you'll be watching this week?Frankel: It's not really a financial-sector stock. I'm looking at Amazon. We talked about them quite a bit. They're down roughly 25% from the highs. I think their new payments system is going to have some traction. Like I said, I personally think that PayPal and the others are going to lose a little bit of their growth trajectory because Amazon has a big existing customer base for this to really play well with. And not just because of that. I think Amazon is a good value. I thought Amazon was a pretty decent value at about $2,000 a share. I really think it's a good value now. There's talk of them offering some kind of co-branded checking account product. Maybe they'll be a financial sector stock after all. I love Amazon this week!Moser: Time will tell. I put nothing past them. That's a good one! I'm going to go with Tiffany (NYSE: TIF), ticker TIF, this week. I know this may seem a little bit of an odd pick, because it's not directly a financial. But I've covered Tiffany for a number of years now. What I have found is that Tiffany is a very good indicator of how the economy is doing and how the market thinks the economy is going to be doing in the coming quarters. You know what we're in right now? It's what I like to call the Larry David economy. Everything is pretty, pretty, pretty good. And I hope that will continue. But I think on Wednesday, when Tiffany's earnings come out, we'll get a better idea.Management recently had raised guidance last quarter, which was impressive. They're going to be investing a lot in their New York flagship store in the coming year. That really does matter for a company like Tiffany that depends on that physical presence. What they do that I think is so phenomenal, they really protect that brand so well. It's a luxury brand. They don't resort to fire sales. You're not going to find big Cyber Monday, half off deals with Tiffany. They protect that brand and do a very good job. When times are good, like they are right now, the stock feels it, and it looks like it's feeling it right now. When times get a little tough, certainly, the stock feels it again. Honestly, that's where investors need to consider potentially investing in a business like this, when times get a little bit tougher.I'm sure on Wednesday, we'll get a better idea of what management sees coming around for the next full year, certainly the holiday quarter guidance. A lot of things you can glean from this luxury retailer in Tiffany's. We'll keep an eye on it.Matt, thanks for joining us this week! I always appreciate your Skyping in. Glad you guys had a good Thanksgiving!Frankel: Hope you had the same!Moser: Yep, it was nice and quiet, and I'm still full.

RP,11-30-2018 06:12PM,AvalonBay Sees Higher-than-Expected Q4 Rental Revenue Growth,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avalonbay-sees-higher-expected-q4-192807994.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Per the recently-announced quarterly update, residential REIT AvalonBay Communities Inc. AVB expects rental revenues for established communities in Q4 to climb 2.5-2.6% from the prior-year quarter.The midpoint of the fourth-quarter outlook denotes a 15-basis-point (bp) expansion from what was expected for the quarter when it provided the 2018 established communities rental revenue growth outlook in October.This projection, however, excludes the impact of the five Manhattan communities that are likely to be contributed to a joint venture during this quarter. Rather, established communities refer to those consolidated communities, which have stabilized occupancy as of Jan 1, 2017, and are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work. These consolidated communities are not held for sale or planned for disposition in the current year.Also, the company provided established communities’ like-term effective rent change for October and November (includes data through Nov 27, 2018). Specifically, like-term effective rent change for both the months was 3% in Northern California and 2.4% in Mid-Atlantic. For Metro NY/NJ, like-term effective rent change was 2.9% for November and 2.7% for October. For the company’s overall established communities, like-term effective rent change was 2.3% for November and 2.7% for October.Moreover, anticipating the closing of the New York JV and the receipt of proceeds from that move, AvalonBay plans to prepay $250 million 6.10% notes due 2020. The company plans to do this on or before Dec 31, 2018. This move will result in the company incurring a prepayment penalty of around $10 million. This is estimated to adversely impact earnings per share and funds from operations (FFO) per share by about 7 cents. However, core FFO per share will bear no impact.Notably, high apartment deliveries have been a case of concern for the U.S. apartment market in recent years because that curtails landlords’ power to raise rents, lowers occupancy level and results in high concessions. But the latest trend in rent seems encouraging and the residential REITs, including AvalonBay, Equity Residential EQR, Essex Property Trust Inc. ESS and UDR Inc. UDR, have a reason to rejoice. In fact, per a monthly data released in October by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. RP, U.S. apartment rental rates went up 3.2% year over year as of October, denoting the fourth consecutive month of slight upward momentum.Particularly, AvalonBay is expected to benefit from its high-quality assets in premium locations, favorable demographics, household formation, recovering economy and job-market growth. However, high supply of new apartments in the markets might dent the growth momentum to some extent in the near term. Rate hike adds to its woes.Currently AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company’s shares have appreciated 2.6% in the past three months compared with its industry’s growth of 1%.

This is expected to be February 27, 2019. On that day, CRM is projected to report earnings of $0.56 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 60%.

CRM,12-03-2018 02:13PM,"While Tech Peers Sputter, Salesforce Sees More Growth Ahead",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/while-tech-peers-sputter-salesforce-220400917.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Another quarter, another beat. As businesses around the world transform operations to excel in a new digital age, cloud software provider salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) is reaping huge rewards. The customer relationship management company continues to execute on its ambitious expansion mission, leaving other tech outfits in the dust. Though many corporations have been voicing concern over an economic slowdown as of late, digital transformation remains a top priority and salesforce.com co-CEO Marc Benioff doesn't see his company losing steam anytime soon. Let's take a look at some of what investors learned from the company's most recent earnings report and conference call with analysts.There were several developments of note in the third quarter of 2018, including Salesforce's adding Apple as a strategic partner for the first time with custom apps for iOS. Salesforce also said it renewed a relationship with one of the world's largest financial services firms (unnamed), good for an undisclosed nine-figure sum. The raw numbers speak for themselves, though. Revenue through the first nine months of the year was up 26% over the year-ago period, building on an impressive run in 2018 and helping the software provider maintain its better than 20% top-line clip that it has kept up for years.MetricNine Months Ended Oct. 31, 2018Nine Months Ended Oct. 31, 2017YOY  GrowthRevenue$9.68 billion$7.68 billion26%Gross profit$7.17 billion$5.64 billion27%Operating profit$398 million$243 million64%Adjusted earnings per share$2.05$1.0792%Data source: Salesforce. YOY = year over year.Guidance for the fourth quarter was good, too, even though results are facing a $330 million reverse swing due to currency headwinds. In 2017, a weaker dollar overseas provided a $130 million bump, versus an expected $200 million adverse affect in the fourth quarter this year. Nevertheless, revenue is now expected to be at least $3.55 billion, and full-year revenue is expected to clock in at at least $13.24 billion -- an increase from previous guidance for at least $13.125 billion.Benioff & Co. see another 20% to 21% rise in the top line in 2019. These numbers -- and the consistency at which the company exceeds its own expectations -- are impressive for a company Salesforce's size. But management is not surprised.Image source: Getty Images.When asked about conversations they're having with other executive teams about the strength of the global economy, Benioff and co-CEO Keith Block said that they can't see the economy growing much faster than it has this past year because businesses simply can't find enough people to hire. In other words, the economy is doing just fine in their opinion. Digital transformation, especially around the customer, also remains a top priority regardless of the economic ebb and flow.Thus, Benioff said, he sees ""several years ahead of good solid growth for the economy. ... We are still in the economy right now and look at these numbers that are ripping and we still see very much a huge investment focus going on.""That should play right into Salesforce's hand. Management said new customers are buying the company's services to lead their digital transformation. Salesforce has a well-integrated platform that can help with all aspects of data management around the customer, leading to big revenue increases from new clients and from existing ones expanding their use of the cloud.SegmentQ3 FY 2019 RevenueYOY IncreaseSales cloud$1.02 billion11%Service cloud$917 million24%Platform and other$742 million51%Marketing and commerce cloud$489 million37%Data source: Salesforce. YOY = year-over-year.Acquisitions made in 2018 are also doing a lot to pitch in, especially the MuleSoft addition at the beginning of the year: $105 million of the Platform segment's revenue came from MuleSoft and its data integration services. But it was noted that the lesser-known purchases of CloudCraze (business-to-business service software) and Datorama (artificial intelligence software) are also assimilating into the Salesforce family smoothly.In short, Salesforce is showing few signs of slowing down anytime soon. The company's suite of cloud-based software is near the heart of a fourth industrial revolution: a digital movement bridging the gap between big data and the real world. With another quarter of strong performance and management predicting at least 20% growth again in 2019, it's hard not to like Salesforce stock right now.More From The Motley FoolNicholas Rossolillo and his clients own shares of Apple and Salesforce.com.

Block, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-CEO & Director [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see from our results, we had another great quarter as we continue to deliver strong growth, customer success and execution at scale.Revenue in Q3 was up 26%, and given the strength of the quarter and our outlook for Q4, we are raising our FY '19 full year revenue guidance to $13.24 billion at the high end of the range. This represents 26% growth this year. Obviously, we are very, very proud of the quarter and momentum in our business and our leadership position in the market.We're also initiating revenue guidance for FY '20 at $16 billion, at the high end of the range, representing 21% growth for the year and demonstrating the incredible demand for the solutions only Salesforce can deliver. We are clearly executing on our vision of transformation and success for our customers, and we are doing it at scale.Every company in the world has a mandate to digitally transform its business. We continue to see this in Q3 with strong performances across every industry, every market segment and every geography. We grew 25% in the Americas, 26% in APAC and 31% in EMEA in constant currency.Now since Dreamforce at the end of September, I've traveled around the world meeting with more than 100 CEOs and world leaders. The conversation is consistent everywhere I go. It's about digital transformation. It's about leveraging our technology. It's about our culture, and it's about our values. This C-level engagement is translating into more strategic relationships than ever. In fact, in Q3, the number of deals generating more than $1 million was up 46% over last year, and the number of $20 million-plus relationships we have continues to grow significantly.In fact, in the quarter, we renewed and expanded a 9-figure relationship with one of the largest financial services institutions in the world. We're very, very excited about this. As you know, an overwhelming majority of our revenue is multi-cloud. Customers like DuPont, Citi, Uber and many others are all driving more meaningful relationships with their customers across sales, service, marketing, commerce, integration and more.I was recently in Australia where I met with dozens of government officials and CEOs across several industries, and many are being challenged by disruption and all agreed that being closer to their customers and citizens is critical to their growth and their success. And this is not unique to Australia. Digital transformation is a global phenomenon. Now we had a great quarter in EMEA, where we strengthened our relationships with Deutsche Telekom, ENGIE, Dyson and Koenig. In APAC, we expanded with Telstra and with [John Spencer] and formed a new relationship with MLC Life Insurance. In Japan, we expanded with heavy industrial manufacturer, IHI, as one of the world's leading manufacturers, auto manufacturers.Our industry strategy, which is all about speaking the language of the customer, continues to drive exceptional growth. Our strong momentum with Financial Services Cloud continued in Q3. And as I mentioned before, one of the largest financial services institutions in the world selected Financial Services Cloud as well as Einstein. Mutual of America Life Insurance also selected Financial Services Cloud, and they're leveraging Salesforce Einstein to improve their go-to-market strategy and customer engagement. Pentagon Federal Credit Union, with nearly 2 million members, is also going all-in with Financial Services Cloud as well as Community Cloud, Einstein and MuleSoft to deliver a best-in-class member experience. And the Salesforce Platform now powers mission-critical applications across the Department of Veterans Affairs, while Service Cloud helps ensure veterans can reach a live support agent 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, very, very important for those folks.We also expanded with a branch at the United States Armed Forces to transform how they engage with the service members from recruitment to retirement, and with Health Cloud, we formed a new relationship with WorkSafe Victoria in Australia, and we expanded our existing relationship with Alcon, one of the world's leading eye care and medical device companies. Now our partners, which are so critical to our growth, they continue to expand our ecosystem, which extends the power of our core offerings. At Dreamforce, we added Apple to our roster of strategic partners, which we're very excited about, and that roster includes Amazon, Google, IBM and others. And this quarter, our SI partners were engaged in 64% of our new business globally and continue to invest in their Salesforce practices. Global partner certifications are up 26% year-over-year, that's the 19th consecutive quarter that our partner certifications have grown by double digits.Finally, we continue to execute again and again with our proven integration model, and as a result, we're already seeing great returns from our acquisitions of MuleSoft and Datorama and CloudCraze. And speaking of MuleSoft, integration has become a strategic imperative for all of our customers and has captured the attention of C-level executives in virtually every conversation I have. And in the quarter, companies like Ahold Delhaize, WeWork, [Michael's Stores] and it continues, just love MuleSoft because MuleSoft is able to unlock data from legacy systems and accelerate their digital transformation.In closing, we are thrilled with our results and our strong momentum heading into Q4 and FY '20. It's been an outstanding year-to-date, and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of $21 billion to $23 billion in revenue in FY '22 faster than any enterprise software company in history.I want to thank our customers, our partners and employees for their trust and continued support. I also want to take a moment to thank the firefighters and first responders who courageously battled the wildfires here in California. Our thoughts remain with them and all of those who have been affected by these terrible events.With that, I will turn the call over to Marc.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All right. Well, thank you so much, Keith, and before I start, I do want to just come back to that and thank all of the first responders and everyone who's worked so hard over the last 2 weeks. We've had a terrible tragedy here in Northern California, also one in Southern California. And certainly here, during the holidays, 14,000 families have lost their homes, 500 businesses. Half of all first responders lost their home in the fires, and it's been a terrible disaster here. This is our -- obviously, we had a terrible fire last year. This one is even worse. It's our worst ever in Northern California, and all of our hearts are with the victims and their families, and also all of our gratitude is with the first responders. We had a city here filled with smoke for a couple of weeks, and that smoke just reminded us how connected we are not only to each other here in San Francisco but all the way up to Butte County. And our hearts remain with them during the season. And we are -- really want to thank not only our employees but also customers, many of whom came to our lobbies here where we filled supplies up and brought them up to Butte County and distributed gift cards. Many of our customers who are retailers helped us procure gift cards for first responders as well as for the families in Butte County. I want to thank them, and we're going to continue to work on that. It is still in our mind, and we're also giving $2 million initially to these relief efforts. And all of us at Salesforce are going to continue to stand with our neighbors and communities across California as we're rebuilding.Thank you for letting me just talk about that for just a moment because it's been something that we've all gone through out here over the last 2 weeks, several weeks.Okay. Now with respect to the numbers. Keith said it. This was absolutely a fabulous third quarter. It was incredible. Obviously, we've given guidance for an incredible fourth quarter coming. I'm hoping the team is going to improve on that even though the fourth quarter guidance is incredible, and here we are at $16 billion for next year and only 2 years from our goal of $22 billion to $23 billion, which is amazing that in fiscal year '22, we have this vision. So thank you to our team and our Ohana for delivering these incredible results. It's just amazing and an incredible moment in history.We are all-in this next year, and I just was talking to Jim Cramer, and it's like, well, what is happening? This is all about the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This is about the cloud. It's about artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning. I mean, there are so many technologies that are happening. I mean, I read this morning in the newspaper about CRISPR being used to genetic editing of twins in China. I mean, we are in a lot of uncharted territory here, and we're going to continue to see incredible expansion. But when it gets right down to digital transformation, well, every digital transformation starts and ends for all of our customers with their customer. And CRM has never been more strategic. You can see that in the growth rates for the CRM marketplaces, remains the fastest-growing market segment enterprise software. That's a big change from when Keith and I started in the enterprise software industry. We both started in 1986, and it was all about other types of technologies that have been downplayed. Now it's all about the customer. It's about CRM, and it's a big and exciting market. We're obviously the largest player. We have these incredible growth rates that we're putting up, and when we look at other companies in the CRM marketplace, a lot of companies are doing very well because this is what it's all about. It's all about the customer. And Salesforce remains this global CRM leader. We're the #1 CRM. We've continued to take share and outpace the market. You can see that in our results as we're moving to $16 billion. This is because we're the only company that is dedicated 100% to CRM at this size and scale. And we're the only company with a complete Customer Success Platform for both these B2B customers and their B2C companies as well.For those of you who joined us at Dreamforce, I always look at that as the ultimate manifestation of our company and how we're doing. You saw the huge turnout, especially compared to some of our competitors. I'm not going to name any names because they're really sensitive. They get upset. But some of our competitors also had conferences recently, didn't have a big, huge turnout like this, 171,000 registered attendees, 10 million watched us online, largest Dreamforce ever. Probably everyone at the call was at Dreamforce. It was incredible. And we saw these amazing companies where Marriott and Brunello Cucinelli was here from Italy and Unilever was here from the United Kingdom, and everyone connected with their customers in a whole new way. We also saw -- my friend to the right here did an incredible new product. Bret Taylor launched his Customer 360. Customer is blown away, connecting all of our clouds together, giving our customers a single 360-degree view of their customers across every touch point, across sales, across service, marketing, commerce but really, thinking now, especially with MuleSoft, how do we give those customers the 360-degree view they so badly want. And that's why it's one of the biggest announcements we've ever made, and I hope Bret will talk about it later on the call. And of course, you can see the acceleration in our business. And also in our positioning, our relationship with our customers in MuleSoft, the #1 integration cloud, giving customers extraordinary power of integration, bringing together vast amounts of data across all kinds of systems in this incredible API architecture. Always loved this company. I love it more now as part of Salesforce. They're right here with us now in Salesforce Tower. Greg and his team, just an incredible job, and we saw that not just at Dreamforce but through the whole quarter, and I think both companies were just hugely surprised at how well it's come together but also their execution is dynamite. And then you also saw the release, again, Bret came up with this with Parker, Einstein Voice, amazing. And you saw these amazing demonstrations of voice, not just interactive voice response but now Salesforce can actually parse the data and actually insert it correctly in the customer database automatically, so anyone can talk to Salesforce, makes every employee and customer more productive, amazing. And Einstein talking to Siri. Einstein and Siri are now friends. Hopefully, they're going to become best friends because we had Apple, for the first time, strategic relationship. Something we've always wanted. At Dreamforce, amazing to have this great relationship with Tim Cook, probably the best executive in our whole industry. Thank you, Tim, for your leadership and what you've done, the relationship with Salesforce. We're very grateful to you.And as we roll out these new mobile apps, our customers are expecting more innovation to come. Now you also saw that we're strengthening our relationships with amazing companies in the cloud world, including Amazon, Google and IBM, delivering these incredible innovations, and our customers are just loving what -- the amount of innovation that's happening in our industry, especially as the cloud becomes mainstream. And at Dreamforce, we're thrilled to announce a new strategic partnership, again, just expanding that capability and giving that -- giving us that capability to have it not only with Amazon and Google but Apple as well and other companies.Okay. Let's talk about Einstein for a second. I told you Einstein was delivering 3 billion productions and insights every day in the last quarter. Well, now, a few months later, we are doing 4 billion Einstein productions every single day, exceeding our expectations. The transformation of all of our products to artificial intelligence, all of our products getting smarter, all of our products having Einstein built-in, that Einstein is at the heart of the Customer Success Platform, making it more powerful and more capable every day. You look at the many layers of our Customer Success Platform. The center is the customer. Then, of course, everything is going in and out of Einstein with Einstein making the customer smarter. Being our partner every day, I know I use that. That's incredibly important to me. Surrounded by this full range of capabilities whether it's sales or service or marketing or commerce or a platform or integration or a community, more enablement or engagement, I mean, all levels of the Customer Success Platform has been made better by Einstein and then wrapped by these amazing trailblazer of communities, so awesome.Now we really saw this weekend, I'll tell you, during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, of course, our customers have deployed this Customer Success Platform, so you're like wondering what's going on. I just got this amazing report. I can't talk about it because it's a public company we're working very closely with, who have this massive success over the weekend, and they're in the retail industry. But I look at all these companies, and we're powering more than 20 million orders in the Customer Success Platform, double-digit growth, amazing. But one thing that really stood out for us was 50% of the orders are placed on the phone. Wow. Mobile traffic to retail sites reaching 67%. So obviously, that's a huge transformation that we've gone through, and our customers, especially retail customers, are going through that.I'd just like to touch base briefly now on our Trailblazers. It's the outer ring of our platform. Our Ohana is so important to us, but especially our Trailblazers, and we've got 1 million of these Trailblazers who are empowered and enabled with all of these capabilities, and they're doing that on Trailhead. For those of you who have not been on trailhead.com, please get on trailhead.com. This is our free online learning platform. It's letting everybody go through the workforce development they need to get into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, to have their place in the digital economy. This is center to our strategy. And you can see that because 1/4 of these customers on Trailhead have self-reported that they have changed jobs because the skills they've gotten on the platform and the jobs they're getting are these phenomenal 6-figure jobs, and we're so excited for all of our Trailblazers. And our goals are to get to millions and millions of these Trailblazers, so really excited.We also saw that we have received -- continued to get some great recognition. And of course, paramount to Salesforce is our culture. Keith and I work on that hand-in-hand every day. That's reflected in our core values of trust, of customer success, of innovation, of quality, but our culture is very important. For those of you who've been to any of our towers around the world, whether it's here in San Francisco or Indianapolis or London or Tokyo or New York, I can tell you, you can feel it when you walk in, the culture is so important to us, and we're trying to cultivate a great culture. But thank you, Fortune Magazine, ranking Salesforce, again, as the #1 best place to work in the world, and that is not just true globally, but in so many of the cities also that we have -- do business in, we've been called out by Fortune magazine, so thank you for that. It's so important to us. And also, I also want to thank -- Harvard Business Review called out Salesforce, and obviously, they said top CEOs in the world, but really calling us out as #6 top company in the world, Harvard Business Review, and #1 American company for best performance for 2018, so thank you Harvard Business Review. We're very, very grateful as well to you.We saw this quarter how the 2 parts of our vision at Salesforce, changing the way the world does business and improving the state of the world, go hand in hand. At the Global Climate Summit at San Francisco, many of you are with us, Salesforce united with 21 other tech companies that stepped up declarations to decarbonize our companies. We realized it's more important. World Economic Forum says that by 2050, we're going to have more plastic in the ocean than fish. Who wants a plastic ocean? I don't. We're deforesting, losing 1 acre of forest every single second. Who wants a planet without a forest? I don't. We need the forest right now more than ever, and this was evangelized by Jane Goodall at the conference because of the carbon situation, so we've got to improve our situation with our climate. So we've continued to focus with others in our industry to decarbonize and to improve our relationship with the climate.Onward to public education. Moving into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we've got to bring the kids with us. That's why we've now put more than $50 million in our local San Francisco and Oakland public schools. This is halfway to our short-term target of $100 million. And everyone knows that we are thrilled that San Francisco passed Proposition C, amazing. And record turnout, incredible turnout. San Francisco is coming to the polls realizing that we can do something together, which is passing Proposition C, spoke to the mayor this morning, and we are very excited moving forward with proposition C.The city will begin collecting the tax January 1, and looking forward to getting that into the hands of the amazing NGOs that we have here in San Francisco, like Hamilton Families, like Larkin Street, like GLIDE, like Catholic Charities, so many people here helping our terrible, horrible homeless situation, and we experience it every day being here. And I know many people who live in cities in the United States are experiencing that homelessness, and there's so many things that we can do. We've learned so much during Prop C and saw so many great insights, but the #1 thing that every homeless person needs is a home. And at this time of the year, during the holidays, all of those homeless people are on our minds more than ever, and thank you for your strong support here in San Francisco and the largest and the most successful businesses all coming out for the good of the homeless. So thank you to Twilio now for giving $1 million and thank you to Airbnb for giving $5 million to homelessness. Since Prop C, others are now able to -- coming in to support the homeless situation, and we plan for another major announcement this week regarding the homeless, so be on the lookout for that. It's another reminder a business does not exist in a bubble. We're part of a city. We're part of a community. We're part of Ohana. We're part of a planet, and we realize we're all connected. We're all one. That our companies are only as strong as these connections in our communities, and that's something Keith and I are talking about all the time, how Salesforce can be a light on to the nations and be a beacon for others and show what is possible when business becomes one of the greatest platforms for change.And with that, let me turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer to talk about how the company did during the quarter. Mark?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mark J. Hawkins, salesforce.com, inc. - President & CFO [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much, Marc. As you've heard, we delivered strong third quarter results as we continue to execute at scale. Third quarter revenue grew 26% in dollars and in constant currency despite experiencing a year-over-year FX headwind to revenue of $15 million and a sequential FX headwind to revenue of $19 million. MuleSoft contributed $128 million to total revenue net of purchase accounting adjustments.Looking at the year-over-year subscription and support revenue by cloud: Sales Cloud grew 11%; Service Cloud grew 24%; Platform and Other grew 51%, including approximately $105 million of MuleSoft; and Marketing and Commerce grew 37%.Dollar attrition exited the quarter below 10%. Operating cash flow was $143 million, up 14% over last year. Third quarter OCF included our first bond coupon payment of approximately $44 million on the MuleSoft acquisition debt. Unearned revenue ended the quarter at nearly $5.4 billion, up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency with MuleSoft contributing approximately $103 million. Unearned revenue was impacted by year-over-year FX headwind of $34 million and a sequential headwind of $39 million in the third quarter.We've always said that unearned revenue can be lumpy due to invoice timing, renewal timing, duration changes, et cetera, and we saw that in the third quarter, where unearned revenue came in a bit better than our guidance. This had the effect of reducing the quarter-on-quarter sequential decline in unearned revenue from Q2 to Q3 we have historically seen. This also has an impact on the sequential change from Q3 to Q4, which I'll discuss in a moment. Total remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenues under contract, ended Q3 at $21.2 billion, up 34% over last year. MuleSoft contributed approximately $300 million to the balance in the quarter. The current portion of the remaining performance obligation, business that is both billed and unbilled, and is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was $10 billion, up 27% year-over-year.Moving on to guidance. We came off a strong third quarter results, we are now once again raising our full fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance to $13.23 billion to $13.24 billion for 26% year-over-year growth. This guidance includes approximately $375 million from MuleSoft.We expect to deliver non-GAAP operating margin improvements of approximately 50 basis points at the high end of our prior guidance range, even while the demand environment gives us the confidence to continue investing in MuleSoft and other growth initiatives. We are raising our FY '19 GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1.06 to $1.07. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $2.60 to $2.61, and keep in mind, this guidance does not take into account the possible future impact related to ASU 2016-01.We are maintaining our full year fiscal 2019 operating cash flow growth guidance of 15% to 16% year-over-year. And as we discussed previously, this guidance includes a headwind of approximately $150 million related to our acquisition of MuleSoft. For Q4, we're expecting revenue of $3.551 billion to $3.561 billion, a GAAP diluted EPS of $0.08 to $0.09 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.54 to $0.55.Turning to unearned revenue. We expect fourth quarter year-over-year unearned revenue growth of approximately 17%. This implies a sequential growth rate of approximately 52%. And let me take a moment to provide some additional context to this UR guidance. First, the FX environment has changed significantly over last year, and we now anticipate a year-over-year FX headwind to UR of approximately $200 million in Q4 versus an FX tailwind of approximately $130 million in Q4 of last year for a $330 million FX swing year-over-year. And now that represents about 5 percentage points of growth. Secondly, as you may recall, in Q4 of last year, we had an extremely strong renewal quarter, including some of the largest renewals in history. This drove outsized growth in our billed and unbilled deferred revenue in Q4 of last year. And thirdly and finally, as we discussed at the most recent Investor Day, the timing of invoices and renewals can impact the UR balance in any given quarter. Third quarter UR came in ahead of our guidance and is a result of this dynamic which has a direct impact on the UR balance in successive quarters and the related sequential changes.As a reminder, this is the last quarter we'll provide unearned revenue guidance. That said, when we report our fourth quarter results, you will have 2 full years of data on the current remaining performance obligation, which we think is a more complete metric because it's contract-based versus invoice-based.Now moving on to FY 2020 guidance. As you've heard from Keith, our demand environment remains very strong, and as a result, we're initiating fiscal 2020 revenue guidance of $15.9 billion to $16 billion for a year-over-year growth of 20% to 21%, keeping us on track to deliver our target of $21 billion to $23 billion of revenue in FY '22, now only a little bit more than 2 years away. We will provide our cash flow, EPS and non-GAAP operating margin guidance for FY '20 when we report our fourth quarter and full year results in February 2019.To close, we delivered another strong quarter results, and we have great momentum as we look to close out the year. I want to thank our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders for your continued support, and I wish you all a wonderful holiday season.And with that, let's open up the call for questions.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Karl Emil Keirstead, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maybe a question for Keith and Marc. Keith, you did mention you've been in front of a lot of customers of late. I'm just wondering whether the tone of those conversations have changed much in the last few months, just not so much in terms of the Salesforce projected spend, that sounds like it's very strong, but just a broader view of the economy and the macro. Don't want to force you into being an economic forecaster, but just wondering if the tone has shifted at all. And then maybe a follow-up for Mark Hawkins. Mark, given that the performance on operating cash flow through the first 9 months, you only need about 5% operating cash flow growth in 4Q to hit your 16% growth target. You're obviously much higher than that last fourth quarter. I just -- I know it's hard to predict, and it's based on timing of invoice payments, but just curious if there's anything you'd flag for us.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keith G. Block, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-CEO & Director [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Karl, it's Keith. So I have been on the road quite a bit actually in the quarter, so I've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time out in the front lines with the troops and our customers. And here's the message I'm hearing. It's all about digital transformation. I am not going to make any comments about the macro environment. From what we see, it's all good. And this is a CEO-level agenda. This transformation is important. The sense I get, regardless of any speculation around the economy, is that this has really become a mandate, and this wave of innovation, this wave of technology that is sweeping the globe, is an imperative for these CEOs to be those Chief Transformation Officers. And that's what's going on in the market, and that's why you see the results with us.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And let me just add to that. I think I said this a little bit already, at Dreamforce as well, which is -- and I've said this recently on TV. When I speak to CEOs, and that happens probably every single day, especially since these tax cuts that have happened, CEOs has been investing aggressively, and the economy has been -- really been ripping. I think that a lot of the forecast that I've seen in the 4% level in the United States, we felt that before that happened -- and we were talking about the economy was ripping even before those aggressive growth estimates. When we look out for next year, I mean, I'm not sure I could see it going faster than it is now because I'm not sure that we -- where are we even going to get all the people to hire that we need to hire, like it's been amazing what's happening not just for us but for all, for everybody. But maybe there's a modest reduction in growth. If it's 2% to 3% next year in the GDP, I wouldn't be hugely surprised. But I don't see some huge sea change in the economy I consider to see strong growth because I have seen so much investment this year. It's going to pay-out for these companies going forward. So I see still several years ahead of good, solid growth for the economy, and where that gets tempered, I think I've mentioned this before, is when I talk to European CEOs, they tend to be more conservative, and some of those CEOs based, maybe specifically in their region are not as optimistic, potentially, as I would say American or Asian or CEOs based in Asia. So that's how I still look at it. That we are still an economy right now, and look at these numbers that are ripping, and we still see very much a huge investment focus going on.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mark J. Hawkins, salesforce.com, inc. - President & CFO [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Let me just jump in the second part of the question, Karl. Thank you for that. Yes, we -- we're obviously pleased with our operating cash flow performance by year-to-date, as you've called out. We're very much tracking the fiscal year number that we have been driving toward ever since we acquired MuleSoft, which we, as we called out, the $150 million debt -- impact, it would be negative in the first year of the acquisition mainly due to debt expansion, some lost interest income. But when you -- the other factor to look at that, besides the fact that we're absolutely tracking our fiscal year, is Q4 is one of the biggest quarters of the year for us, and obviously, we'll know more as we get to the end of that. We feel that this is appropriate to stay with the fiscal number, especially in light of the fact that in Q4, there's clearly an FX headwind if you just look at the FX rates year-on-year, that's another factor to be considered. We're staying on track for the year. We'll know more at the end of the quarter, but given the FX headwind, I think this is totally appropriate.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Philip Alan Winslow, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just really want to focus on just the concept of the front office suite. Obviously, you guys are talking about that for several years now, and we're obviously believers. If you think about this year, we've seen probably north of $15 billion of M&A from some of your competitors trying to build out different pillars of a suite. What are you hearing from your customers in terms of the competitive landscape, especially sort of post-M&A and even beyond M&A, some of the data sharing initiatives out there between frenemies, what are you hearing from customers? How do you think about how the landscape's changed?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keith G. Block, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-CEO & Director [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I think that we should ask our President of Products. Bret Taylor is here to kind of give you his vision of where we're going with our Customer Success Platform.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bret Steven Taylor, salesforce.com, inc. - President & Chief Product Officer [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. I think our strategy as it relates to competition is really reflected in our Dreamforce announcements, particularly Customer 360. We talk to our customers, they're not looking to buy a piece of technology, looking to transform their business. And our strategic advantage is that we're the #1 in sales, the #1 in service, the #1 in platform, the #1 in marketing. And as you look at Black Friday, I think you can really see this in the way our customers are using every single one of those technologies to transform their customer experience. You might send out a promotion for your Black Friday sales via text message or via e-mail on our Marketing Cloud. You transact in our Commerce Cloud. You provide service through our Service Cloud. We are the only company that can provide all of these solutions in an integrated way. And now with Customer 360, you have a single view of your customer through all those touch points. And so our strategic advantage relative to competitors who are trying to catch up by acquiring the second-place product in each of these spaces is that we are an integrated solution. And Keith and I have talked a lot about this. Our customers are looking for an integrated solution to their business problems, not just pieces of technology, and that's a strategic advantage in our product portfolio.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So Bret, you've done a great job. I mean, when we look at that product portfolio, when we look at what you built out the Customer Success Platform, you've got, of course, sales. You've got service and field service. You've got marketing. You've got B2C and B2B commerce. You've got engagement with Heroku, which has been a -- still remains on a tear. You've got platform and this incredible ecosystem. You've got integration not just with Customer 360, but with this work with MuleSoft. You've got advanced analytics. The work with industries, we saw what Financial Services Cloud did this quarter. We've got partners and communities enablement, collaboration, and on top of all of that, you have that whole Trailblazer community. I don't think there's any company that has built out a comprehensive Customer Success Platform like that. Now when you got to Dreamforce and saw it all tied together with Customer 360, what was your biggest surprise?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bret Steven Taylor, salesforce.com, inc. - President & Chief Product Officer [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------My biggest takeaway was the importance of Trailhead and that Trailblazers community. Essentially, when one of our customers decided to deploy our technology, we're not the only person there helping them. Our partner ecosystem is there with them. And that partner ecosystem is fueled by Trailhead. One of the things that you mentioned, Marc, in your opening I think is really powerful, there's over 1 million people learning for free on Trailhead, and 1 in 4 have gotten a new job on the other side of that because they're developing new skills. And the way you should think about it from our customer's perspective and the thing that you see in spades at Dreamforce is when someone decides to deploy Salesforce, they have the best ecosystem of support and the best partner community around them. That's why it was driving the success of our customers with the technology which is the thing that we are exclusively focused on.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question will come from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------James Derrick Wood, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Software Analyst [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keith, one of the things we commonly heard at Dreamforce is that partners are finding it harder to hire and build up Salesforce-certified resources to meet the demand, which is, I guess, essentially saying that demand is outstripping supply from a consulting and implementation standpoint. Do you hear this as a trend in the field from your partners? And do you ever see it weighing on pipeline conversion cycles? And then you were just talking about Trailhead. I know it's been in the market for a little bit. How effective do you view Trailhead in helping to virally cultivate resources and can it help maybe populate talent in a quicker fashion than you've historically seen?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keith G. Block, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-CEO & Director [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So thanks for the question. So as you know, the relationship that we've had with our partners is very strategic to our business. You heard me talk about it in the call that they're involved in about 64% of our go-to-market efforts. And the certification, 19 conservative quarters of double-digit certification growth, I mean, you go talk to any of these firms, whether it's PwC or Deloitte or Accenture or IBM, and ask them what their fastest-growing practices at scale, it's Salesforce. And this is great news for our customers because we wake up every day, as you know, as a company, and we think about what's important for our customers. And the partner ecosystem is certainly a big part of that. We are very, very focused on our partners, and we have plans with them to not only increase their capacity, but also to enhance their capability. And the centerpiece for that is Trailhead and offering and extending Trailhead for them to make sure that they get the right skills at the right time so that they can convert and cannibalize their practices from their legacy providers. And that's been a part of their strategy. We also encourage the growth of boutiques, but it's not just in the enterprise space -- business. It's also in the mid-market and the SMB. And we invest, it's part of our funds, with Salesforce Ventures to provide start-ups the opportunity to build and cultivate these boutique practices to help with the SMB. So we've got a pretty comprehensive strategy to build out these SMBs, SMB boutique consulting firms, these Accentures of the world, et cetera. And in my entire career, I've never seen a closer relationship with the SI ecosystem like the one that we have with Salesforce. We do a lot of joint planning. There's a lot of collaboration. They are very integrated in everything that we do inside this company. And again, they're a big part of our future, and we're very optimistic that they will continue to expand and convert the resources they need to drive success for our customers.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So Keith, let me ask you a question. Let's say there's an entrepreneur listening on the call today, and they are hearing what you're saying. Are you saying that if I am an entrepreneur and I want to start a new company, starting a company providing these kinds of boutique services in the Salesforce ecosystem, that's a good business opportunity? And is Salesforce investing in those companies? Are you going to invest?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keith G. Block, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-CEO & Director [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That is a fantastic business opportunity. That's one of the reasons why we've got the consulting funds that have been set up with Salesforce Ventures around the world.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And then we've seen so many of those boutiques get acquired by the mainstream SIs and motivate and grow their practices aggressively.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keith G. Block, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-CEO & Director [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Absolutely. And the important thing for us to continue to do is to keep cultivating and growing those practices at the mid-market space.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And when you look at some of these companies that were strong, independent companies like Bluewolf is a great example, we're very...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keith G. Block, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-CEO & Director [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Acquired by IBM.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So many others. But they've been acquired now by the very largest and most important systems integrators, and so this remains a great opportunity for everybody.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD and Head of Software [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have a bit of a philosophical question. You're sitting on some big markets, massive TAM, $145 billion. But only one of your clouds is really dominant in terms of market share in its industry, which is Sales Cloud. I'm curious at what point like some of the commanding technology companies, the SGAs, that's Oracle in the database market or Microsoft in the operating system market, where they've defined the market. So at what point are we -- how close are we to a tipping point where service, marketing, commerce, platform, all these markets really start to tip in your way that it's not really so much of outbound -- of course, there's always going to be outbound selling motion but the market really starts to come to you and you start to get these dominant shares in the other markets so you can start to realize your TAM, $145 billion in a more significant way. That's it for me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kash, I think you'd really see this in the growth rate that we're reporting on all of the clouds. So this is not anything that we're trying to keep from you. You can see it in the numbers that we are -- it's an abundance of riches at Salesforce. And yes, we have a great product with Sales Cloud that's doing just fine. But we also have a phenomenal service business and field service business and service add-on business, that's also growing extremely well. We also have an amazing Marketing Cloud business that's growing extremely well, and Commerce, and I've mentioned Heroku. It doesn't get reported but it's part of our platform, obviously, very important part of our platform, integrated, which is also a great business. And now we have an integration business, which is also -- it's an unbelievable business, and we have an Analytics Cloud that's an unbelievable business, and we have industries that Keith has cooked up with Financial Services and Health Cloud, which is also an unbelievable business. And we keep -- and by the way, we acquired Bret Taylor's company, Quip, which is an unbelievable business and that just did a huge deal with Citibank for the quarter. I mean, that was awesome to see what Citi did with Quip, enabling all of their employees around the world, so congratulations to Bret and Kevin, helping Citi work together faster in this incredible productivity environment. It's a product I use every day. If you haven't downloaded it, it's what Amazon uses. It's what Apple uses, what Citibank uses to manage their productivity. And you saw it at Dreamforce. We now [quick slides] which is incredible. But it's an abundance of riches. And the key organizing principle though for us is, the customer. So yes, we're in all these areas, but there's other companies in service and there's other companies in marketing and there's other companies in a lot of these areas but our organizing principle is that we're here to tie it all together to give you a 360-degree view of your customer, and that's what's unique for Salesforce. Every company has its own organizing principle, as you know, because you cover all these companies and you know what ours is and you know what our answer is going to be, that everything begins and ends with the customer. Bret, do you want to add to that?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bret Steven Taylor, salesforce.com, inc. - President & Chief Product Officer [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------No. I think Marc put it exactly right. And the backdrop that I'm really excited about and the reason why I think you see such amazing growth in Service Cloud platform, Marketing Cloud and continued growth in our Sales Cloud is these products aren't staying still. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is transforming each of these markets. Take Service Cloud, which is just an amazing product with an amazing growth rate. Right now, artificial intelligence is completely transforming that industry. That's driving every CEO to Salesforce to say, hey, how can you help me transform my customer service experience, which is really the tip of the spear as it relates to customer experience, and that's why Service Cloud is growing 24% year-over-year, one of our largest and fastest-growing businesses, and you're seeing this in every single cloud. So as a technologist here, what's exciting for me is not just really TAM, but also just to see the motion of change in each of these businesses and how we can help our customers navigate these technology changes happening around them.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question will come from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Patrick D. Walravens, JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Technology Research and Senior Research Analyst [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. So MuleSoft is clearly proving to have been a great decision for you. What sorts of things might make sense for Salesforce to buy next? And then Marc, I'd love to hear your thoughts, if it fits in there, on SAP's acquisition of Qualtrics?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I mean, I can just tell you that there's a lot of things that Salesforce can do because this customer opportunity is much bigger and more exciting I think than anybody ever realized. But for MuleSoft, this is a company that I've loved for years. This is a company that I helped lead our early investing in and then helped -- we helped them to go public and so forth. And while I wanted to buy them for years, unfortunately, I have a very strong and stubborn management team that's sitting around the table. And they're not that easy to deal with, and they make it hard for me to do what I want to do. But I did get that one over the line, so thank God for that. But there's a lot of others that I would love to see that I think that our customers would love to have more tightly integrated, more part of our product, it's really important. And with other companies -- I don't know if you've seen the front of The Wall Street Journal lately, but we put a market share graph, CRM, on the cover of The Wall Street Journal. Have you seen it? I think we had it -- we also put it in our slide deck here for you, hopefully we did, because it's our #1 marketing graphic. And not everyone is doing as well as we are in CRM, so -- and not everyone is doing as well as we are in cloud. And you know that. So every year, they've got some new thing, whatever, and I can't follow them all because they're all so difficult. And they buy companies I have never heard of, so I can't really comment on them. But God bless them. And I hope that they're successful in CRM because it's been good for us.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Aleksandr J. Zukin, Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I want to ask a question about verticals, maybe with Keith, you talked about some amazing success in financial services, the big deal with the financial institution, with the success being driven by Financial Services Cloud which we also picked up on our field work. I guess, I wanted to understand, could you talk about what is the incremental kind of value prop and features that are available to customers that go from generic service cloud to Financial Service Cloud? And any commentary on the financial uplift that Salesforce sees through those migrations would be appreciated.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keith G. Block, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-CEO & Director [31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, Alex, listen, I'm happy to get into a feature function conversation with you if you'd like, but here's the way I would think about Financial Services Cloud. So first, in the beginning of time, there was the Service Cloud, right? And then on the seventh day, God created something else, and said it was Financial Services Cloud. And then Financial Services Cloud started on in wealth management. And then it went from wealth management to retail banking. Then it went to consumer banking, and then went over to commercial banking. And the list would go on and on. And oh, by the way, Financial Services Cloud has made great integration points with partners like Guidewire and Velocity as well. So those are compelling solutions for our customers. At the end of the day, this is a capability that -- customers love to buy off-the-shelf software. They don't want to be customizing and building their own capabilities because, in a sense, that's just repainting the [cow house], you're just doing a tech refresh, but really, you're not retiring your legacy debt. And that's why customers want these capabilities embedded in our technology. And that's exactly what we're doing. We're responding to our customers in these industries by providing a very rich functionality that is specific to what those customers are looking for. And that's been the strategy. Now we can do that 2 ways. One is that we can enhance our product so that these customers get commercially available off-the-shelf software or we can go partner with an ISV like an Infinome or a Velocity or the others that I mentioned. So that has been our strategy. You can see the results. If you think about the pace of Financial Services Cloud, arguably, it's the most successful cloud that we've ever launched. It has established very deep and meaningful relationships with our customers. The roster of financial services companies that we're doing business with now, they all want Financial Services Cloud. And we just continue to win and win and win in that space, so it's very, very exciting for us.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------To answer the previous question where there was a question about how we're doing with our competitors, so I put on my Twitter feed for you the market share information, so you could get that directly.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keith G. Block, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-CEO & Director [33]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I do want to make a comment about the competitors because I've been listening to Marc and Bret talk about them. So just to -- a lot of these companies have been in the business for a very, very long time. They've been in the legacy business. They have not been in the cloud business. They claim that they could be cloud companies because maybe they have an architecture that suggests they're part of the cloud. But it's not just about the architecture. It's also about the business model, but most importantly, it's about the culture of the company and the focus on customer. And since the day this company was started, everything that we do is focused on the customer. If you go look at some of these legacy companies, they're trying to get in the game of the front office and say that they're now CRM companies, it's not in their DNA. So as Marc said, we wish them luck and we'll see you in the marketplace, but please don't underestimate the importance of having the customer as part of the culture.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [34]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And I have -- really had to start to curtail my comments. And as I love to talk about specific companies and other CEOs, every time I do, I get a phone call. They're very sensitive. And I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings during the holidays. So I'm really holding back on this call. So I'm just going to do that one tweet today.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [35]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thomas Michael Roderick, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD [36]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A question for Marc Benioff. Marc, you're constantly in touch with global tech leaders, partners. And going back to Dreamforce, you certainly have nice updates relative to Google as a partner, some of the things you're working on there. They, of course, have had some changes at the leadership at the top. I'd love to hear a little bit more if you could talk about how that partnership has progressed. And now that they are sort of going through some new leadership changes at the top, what sort of opportunities exist to further extend that partnership? AWS has been fantastic. This one has a nice sort of start off the ground with the analytics side, where can you take it from here?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, we got -- you just mentioned 2 great companies, the Amazon and Google, who have -- both have phenomenal cloud offerings. They both have very strong CEOs. Jeff is amazing and also, Sundar is amazing. And they're both doing extremely well in our customer base. We see lots of action with both of those customers and partners. And specific to Google, I mean, Bret, obviously, is the creator of Google Maps and worked for Google for a while. So I don't know if you want to touch on how you -- if you have a unique perspective in all of these.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bret Steven Taylor, salesforce.com, inc. - President & Chief Product Officer [38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. I just felt that it's such a great privilege to have such amazing partners, and we really work backwards from customer success and what do our customers need to be successful. When I look at Amazon Web Services, Apple, Google, we're really saying, we're the companies that our customers want to partner with and who do they want us to partner with to drive success. And when I look at Google, every single one of our Marketing Cloud customers, Commerce Cloud customers have a deep relationship with Google because of the prominence of Google Search, their ad network, marketing, analytics. And so I really view this as an amazing opportunity to bring the best of both companies to bear when we're trying to provide the solutions to our customers. And our customer response has just been fantastic, and we -- I hope to deepen that relationship in the future and just make sure that when we provide these solutions to our customers, the products work together, our types of companies work together and our customers have an amazing experience.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question will come from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jennifer Alexandra Swanson Lowe, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst [40]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As you start to talk with CEOs and senior decision-makers about these big, strategic digital transformation projects, and you mentioned many of them are multiyear in scope, it strikes me that these touch a lot of systems, a lot of processes and it's a challenge to sort of figure out what comes first. But as you sort of start through that prioritization process, how often are you going in and creating a new application that didn't exist before versus replacing legacy off-the-shelf software versus custom app development or replacing legacy custom applications? And how has that evolved as you increase your strategic value to those customers?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keith G. Block, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-CEO & Director [41]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is Keith. So that's a great question. The way I would think about this is that the whole environment is just ripe for innovation, okay? The innovation could be something that's custom-developed, it could -- with our technology, or it could be something that's just using our standard products. Obviously, customers like to take advantage of the flexibility that our products provide, and they want to model their processes aligned to our technology rather than building custom apps themselves, comma. The power of the technology is such nowadays that you can do amazing things that you couldn't have done before. So it's kind of hard to give you an apples-to-apples comparison, but it's really an interesting phenomenon because the wave of innovation is just so impressive in what we're seeing in the marketplace. And that innovation is supported by our platform. It's supported by our Service Cloud, our whole Customer Success Platform. So it's hard to give you an exact number, but it's all about innovation and creating your impossible.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc R. Benioff, salesforce.com, inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO [42]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All right. Well, as we bring our call to a close, I want to thank everybody for participating on today's call. As I opened the call, I also mentioned our hearts remain with everyone who suffered during the horrible fires. And I'd like to bring your attention to our local organization who is doing so much and has done so much support already, which is our North Valley Community Foundation, which is providing tremendous support for the Camp Fire Relief. And if you can support them, we would appreciate it, it's nvcf.org, as in Nancy-Victor-Charlie-Frank-dot-org. North Valley Community Foundation and our hearts are with the entire community of Paradise and the surrounding areas affected by the campfire. We would love for you to please consider a tax-deductible donation to the Camp Fire Relief fund and to assist in the many community organizations who are serving evacuees and especially our tremendous first responders. So thank you, everybody, and I look forward to talking to you again next quarter.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [43]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This will conclude our program, and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day."
CRM,12-02-2018 06:13PM,2 Great Stocks for Your IRA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-great-stocks-ira-151000540.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.One of the best ways to maximize the growth of your individual retirement account is to invest in the stocks of competitively dominant businesses. It's even better if these companies have massive long-term growth opportunities that align with your investment time horizon. Done well, this strategy can help you build vast wealth by the time you retire.To help you in this regard, here are two of the best growth stocks for your IRA available in the market today.Image source: Getty Images.Few companies possess as many long-term growth drivers as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN). The online juggernaut is the dominant e-commerce platform in the U.S. and many other areas of the world. That's a particularly valuable position to be in, as -- despite years of torrid growth -- e-commerce remains just a small fraction of overall retail sales in most countries.Incredibly, Amazon may have an even more powerful growth driver in its cloud-computing business. Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud infrastructure platform and has a greater-than-50% share of that market, according to research firm Gartner. Moreover, Gartner projects that the global cloud computing market will grow to more than $278 billion by 2021, up from $145 billion in 2017. This massive and rapidly expanding market should continue to fuel Amazon's growth in the coming years.Add to this fast-growing advertising, smart-home technology, and grocery businesses, and it's clear that Amazon has many ways to win.Yet Amazon's shares have pulled back sharply along with the rest of the market in recent weeks. With the stock now down almost 20% from its all-time high, Amazon currently trades at about 60 times forward earnings estimates. That's a fair price to pay for a competitively dominant business that's expected to grow its earnings by more than 44% annually over the next half-decade. Thus, you may want to use this recent market downturn as an opportunity to add some Amazon stock to your IRA.Like Amazon, salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) has incredible long-term growth prospects. Salesforce is the global leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software, the largest and fastest-growing segment in the enormous enterprise software market.Salesforce dominates its industry; its CRM market share is greater than that of its three nearest competitors combined. Better still, Salesforce is likely to see its market share increase in the coming years. Its recent acquisition of MuleSoft is a game changer. MuleSoft's best-in-class data integration solutions are enjoying strong demand and helping Salesforce win new business at a rapid clip.Fueled in part by MuleSoft's torrid growth, Salesforce expects to nearly double its current revenue base to $23 billion by fiscal 2022. Yet even if the company achieves its goal -- and all signs suggest that it will -- Salesforce's revenue would account for only about 4% of the $537 billion in enterprise software spending that Gartner estimates will take place at that time. That leaves plenty of market opportunity for Salesforce to capture, particularly as its data integration services grow in importance in the years ahead.Like Amazon, Salesforce's shares have pulled back in recent weeks along with the market. Down more than 10% from its all-time high, Salesforce now trades for about 52 times forward earnings estimates -- a reasonable price for an elite business that's projected to increase its profit more than 30% annually over the next five years. As such, you may want to consider adding this outstanding growth stock to your IRA today.More From The Motley FoolJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

CRM,12-01-2018 06:13PM,Salesforce is not the fastest-growing enterprise software company ever — it's Amazon,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-not-fastest-growing-enterprise-170000698.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Marc Benioff reiterated a familiar refrain this week after Salesforce's earnings report, telling CNBC's Jim Cramer that his company ""remains the fastest-growing enterprise software company of all time.""But he's wrong.Amazon Web Services, with $6.7 billion in quarterly revenue , is about twice the size of Salesforce, which on Tuesday reported fiscal third-quarter sales of $3.4 billion. AWS was created inside Amazon AMZN in 2006, about seven years after Benioff co-founded Salesforce.Benioff isn't completely off the mark. Among independent software companies, Salesforce did reach $10 billion in annual sales faster than any of its predecessors. If it can meet Benioff's prediction of reaching $20 billion by 2022, it will be the quickest to that mark as well.But AWS could surpass $70 billion that year, according to a Nov. 28 report from Jefferies.'Cloud momentum was evident'AWS had the luxury of growing up inside a big public company that was already beloved on Wall Street, while Benioff started Salesforce with seed capital, then funded it with venture money before turning to the public markets.But that was then. AWS is now the profit engine behind its parent. As the company made abundantly clear at its annual re:Invent conference this week, its growth ambitions should have legacy technology vendors very much on edge.More than 50,000 attendees swarmed onto the Las Vegas Strip for five days of keynotes, breakout sessions, demos and developer training sessions. Another 100,000 streamed parts of the conference online.AWS took off in its early years by providing remote servers that any start-up or developer could use to launch a website or project. As companies became more dependent on AWS' core computing and storage offerings, Amazon started rolling out adjacent products like databases, a content delivery network and a data warehouse service, and then began upgrading its products so they could be used in highly regulated industries like banking and health care.Amazon now offers 140 services, which a growing number of businesses use to run all of their core computing.It's not stopping with cloud infrastructure, either.AWS said this week that it has developed its own chips for artificial intelligence projects, following Google into the silicon for AI market. And Amazon said it will soon start bringing its technology into other companies' facilities with branded hardware , stepping into the physical data center world of Cisco CSCO , Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE .""A key theme that emerged as we spoke to many users and partners of AWS is that while competition is increasing, AWS' continuous focus on newer products, services, and depth of features sets it apart,"" wrote Ronald Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities, in a report on Thursday. ""The announcements this week confirm this view.""On Wednesday, Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies wrote in a note to clients that, ""AWS Cloud momentum was evident with 3+ days still left in the conference.""Thill, who recommends buying Amazon shares, estimates that based on potential 2022 revenue of $71 billion, AWS could be worth $350 billion on its own, a market value that today is higher than all but eight U.S. companies, including Amazon. Salesforce currently has a market capitalization of $107 billion after a 40 percent rally this year.Investors shouldn't be looking to a potential AWS spinoff, however. The $2.1 billion of operating profit the unit generated in the latest quarter accounted for 56 percent of Amazon's total operating earnings, providing significant cash for CEO Jeff Bezos to pour into other lower-margin areas.AWS CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC's Jon Fortt this week, ""I'll never say never about anything,"" but ""we don't have any plans on the horizon"" to leave Amazon.""Usually companies will spin off groups if they just for some reason don't want them on their books or if that new unit needs access to capital that it can't get by being part of the broader company,"" Jassy said. ""Amazon has been so just incredibly generous about funding AWS so aggressively over the 15 years we've been working on this that there's really been no need for additional capital.""Salesforce on a tearEven if Salesforce isn't as big as AWS or growing as quickly, the company is still on a tear and rewarding investors handsomely.On Wednesday, Salesforce reported 26 percent growth for the quarter, topping analysts' estimates for sales and profit. Just as AWS is winning business from companies that are pushing their infrastructure to the cloud, Salesforce's momentum is coming from companies turning to the cloud and mobile devices for applications used by salespeople, marketers and service departments.Salesforce itself is a big AWS customer, committing in 2016 to spending $400 million over four years on Amazon's cloud platform. In September the two companies expanded their partnership to make it easier for customers to use more Salesforce applications on AWS.""We have a fantastic partnership with AWS,"" a Salesforce spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The combination of Amazon's cloud service and Salesforce's customer relationship management software delivers ""great value and benefits to our mutual customers,"" the statement said.Salesforce also partners with Google's cloud, and Benioff said on the earnings call this week that both companies have ""phenomenal cloud offerings.""There's plenty of headroom remaining for AWS and Salesforce. Gartner estimates IT spending will reach $3.7 trillion in 2018, with public cloud spending only accounting for $186.4 billion of that amount.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.More From CNBC"

CRM,12-01-2018 06:13PM,Tech Stocks This Week: 2 Cloud Stocks Are Crushing It,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-stocks-week-2-cloud-151100608.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.In a change of pace following a market downturn that lasted nearly two months, the S&P 500 gained about 5% this week. Tech stocks saw an even better rebound, as evidenced by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite's 5.6% rise over the same time frame. Of course, tech stocks were slammed harder than the overall market leading up to this upbeat week. Between Oct. 1 and Nov. 23, the Nasdaq Composite had declined nearly 14% while the S&P 500 fell just 10%.Amid this week's rebound in tech stocks, two stocks from the hot software-as-a-service cloud sector helped set the tone. salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) both saw their stocks soar this week, rising 17% and 22%, respectively. Both of these stocks' gains were helped by better-than-expected third-quarter financial results.Image source: Getty Images.Here's a look at each of these companies' latest financial results -- and why investors love them.Customer relationship management platform company Salesforce beat expectations in its third quarter of fiscal 2019 with revenue of $3.39 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.61. On average, analysts were expecting revenue of $3.37 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.50.Impressively, Salesforce's revenue was up 26% year over year. Subscription and support revenue, which accounts for 93% of the company's total revenue, was up 26% year over year. The remaining revenue, from professional services, was up 15% compared to the year-ago quarter.Of the different cloud platforms that contribute to Salesforce's subscription and support revenue, the sales cloud is the biggest. Sales cloud revenue climbed 11% year over year to $1.02 billion. The service cloud segment saw revenue rise 24% year over year; the segment including the Salesforce platform and other cloud revenue grew 51%; and marketing and commerce cloud revenue increased 37%. But Salesforce's platform and other cloud segment was notably helped by over $100 million of revenue from the company's recent acquisition of Mulesoft.While Salesforce's stronger-than-expected growth was likely the primary reason for the Street's optimistic response to the company's third-quarter results, management's decision to raise its outlook for full-year revenue probably played a part as well. The company now expects full-year fiscal 2019 revenue to rise about 26% year over year. Previously, management had guided for 25% growth.Salesforce may have beat expectations. But Workday crushed expectations. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the company's revenue rose 34% year over year to $743 million. Not only was this an acceleration from the 28% revenue growth in Q2, but revenue was far ahead of a consensus analyst estimate of $723 million. Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share jumped from $0.24 in the year-ago quarter to $0.31 -- easily beating a consensus forecast for $0.14.""We're pleased with our strong performance in Q3, which resulted in accelerated growth across our core business metrics and gives us great momentum heading into year-end,"" said Workday CFO Robynne Sisco in the company's third-quarter earnings release.While Workday's core human capital management suite of applications saw strong growth during the quarter, its financial management apps and business intelligence platform saw outsize growth.Workday's big outperformance on its top and bottom lines, combined with the fact that revenue growth accelerated significantly compared to Q2, gives investors reason to be more confident in the company's growth story.Both companies' results show that businesses are as aggressive as ever in their efforts to become more efficient digitally.More From The Motley FoolDaniel Sparks has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

CRM,11-30-2018 06:13PM,Salesforce Smashed Its Own Targets Again,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-smashed-own-targets-again-003000179.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Investors in salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) have become accustomed to the company's practice of exceeding its forecast and raising its full-year guidance. Having done just that for the first two quarters of fiscal 2019, the stock had risen more than 57% before the recent downturn. Salesforce was able to continue its robust performance in the third quarter.For the fiscal 2019 third quarter, which ended Oct. 31, 2018, Salesforce reported revenue that grew to $3.39 billion, an increase of 26% year over year, exceeding its forecast, which topped out at $3.365 billion, as well as surpassing analysts' consensus estimates of $3.37 billion. This outperformance continued down to the bottom line, resulting in higher-than-expected profitability, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.61, soaring past both the company's guidance and Wall Street's expectations of $0.50.Image source: Salesforce.The lion's share of revenue for Salesforce continues to come from its subscription and support services, which increased 26% year over year to $3.17 billion. Professional services and other revenue also saw strong growth to $224 million, up 15% compared to the prior-year quarter.The company's growing portfolio of products all produced gains. Revenue from the Sales Cloud increased 11% year over year to top $1 billion. Service Cloud revenue grew even more, topping $900 million, up 24% year over year. The two smallest segments enjoyed the largest percentage growth, with the Salesforce Platform and Other up 51% year over year to $700 million, and the Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud growing to $500 million, up 37% compared to the prior-year quarter.Growth was also strong across Salesforce's various geographical regions. The Americas still accounts for the majority of the company's business, generating $2.425 billion, up 25% year over year. Sales in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) grew to $641 million, while revenue in the Asia Pacific region (APAC) climbed to $326 million, up 29% and 25% year over year, respectively.The company's remaining performance obligation, which is comprised of future revenue that is under contract but has not yet been recognized, grew to $21.2 billion, up 34% year over year. The portion that will be realized over the coming 12 months grew to $10 billion, an increase of 27% compared to the year-ago quarter.Several other tidbits of information provide additional insight into Salesforce's growing potential.On the conference call to discuss the results, co-CEO Keith Block said the company continues to engage with c-suite executives, which is ""translating into more strategic relationships than ever."" During the third quarter, the number of deals valued at more than $1 million increased 46% year over year, and the number of those above $20 million ""continues to grow significantly.""Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block addressing a crowd. Image source: Salesforce.The company gained Apple as a strategic partner, adding to its already impressive array of household names, including Amazon, Alphabet's Google, and IBM. These partnerships allow customers to deeply integrate Salesforce with the data and capabilities of their partners, which provides greater opportunities for deeper insight and analysis.Part of Salesforce's expansion strategy has revolved around acquiring companies whose technology seamlessly integrates with its own, and the company has reported seeing ""great returns"" from recent acquisitions MuleSoft, Datarama, and Cloud Craze. MuleSoft's ability to unlock data from legacy systems has become an important incentive to potential customers and a component of the company's ongoing growth.Salesforce pointed out that by 2020, 60% of enterprises will have ""fully articulated an organization-wide digital transformation platform strategy,"" and 90% will use multiple cloud services and platforms. This gives the company a growing opportunity in an expanding cloud market.Based on the company's continued strong results, Salesforce boosted its full-year outlook for the third time in as many quarters. The company is anticipating revenue in a range of $13.23 billion to $13.24 billion, which would represent growth of 26% year over year at the midpoint of its guidance, and a $760 million, or 6%, increase from its initial estimates from a year ago.Salesforce also released its initial guidance for fiscal 2020 and is forecasting revenue in a range of $15.9 billion to $16 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of between 20% and 21%. It's also a bit higher than analysts had anticipated, as consensus estimates had pegged revenue at $15.75 billion. In late 2017, Salesforce announced that it planned to more than double its revenue -- from $8.4 billion to $20 billion by 2022. This shows that the company is well on track to achieving its goal.For the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter, Salesforce is forecasting revenue in a range of $3.551 and $3.561 billion, year-over-year growth of 25% at the midpoint of its guidance. The company is also anticipating GAAP earnings per share of $0.08 to $0.09, and non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.54 and $0.55.Salesforce has shown time and again that it can under-promise and over-deliver, and this quarter's beat-and-raise is just another in a long line of stellar performances.More From The Motley FoolJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The broad market sell-off, stemming from concerns about the global economy, was having an outsized impact on stocks that had enjoyed the biggest rallies over the prior 12 months. Salesforce CRM fell to its lowest since April.Those concerns dissipated in a hurry this week, thanks to blowout earnings from the top cloud software companies and reassuring commentary from their leaders.""The new normal in the world is political volatility and hopefully it doesn't have a huge amount of impact on our business,"" said Workday WDAY CEO Aneel Bhusri in a call with analysts after his company's earnings report Thursday afternoon.Whatever concerns companies have about a potential trade war, the economy and political instability have done nothing to slow down Workday's momentum. The company reported 34 percent revenue growth in the fiscal third quarter, its fastest growth in a year, with sales and earnings topping analysts' estimates.Workday shares surged 13 percent on Friday to a record $164, lifting its gain for the week to 21 percent. The stock got a boost earlier in the week from cloud peer Salesforce, which reported results on Tuesday that blew past estimates.Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff refers to the broadly changing landscape as a ""digital transformation"" that's leading businesses to buy technologies to help them manage and analyze the massive influx of data. Even if the economy sputters, companies will keep spending money on applications that are critical to running their business, whether it's infrastructure like cloud servers or software for tracking sales and managing payroll.Salesforce shares climbed 17 percent this week. After Tuesday's earnings report, Benioff called the quarter ""phenomenal"" in an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer, and said that with visibility into the next fiscal year, ""I don't think the company has ever been stronger.""As the biggest and most valuable software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, Salesforce has a tendency to pull the rest of the industry along with it. The Bessemer Venture Partners Emerging Cloud Index, which consists of 46 publicly-traded cloud software companies, jumped 9 percent this week, about twice as much as the S&P 500. Okta OKTA , Atlassian TEAM , Twilio TWLO and ServiceNow all climbed more than 15 percent.Jason Lemkin, a start-up investor and founder of SaaStr , said that chief information officers are dedicating almost twice as much money as a percentage of their budget to cloud platforms as they were five years ago, benefiting this whole class of suppliers.""We're all stunned at how big these SaaS and cloud companies are,"" Lemkin said. ""The valuations are priced to perfection but nothing seems to be able to stop the migration of the CIO budget to the cloud. All of us got that wrong.""Salesforce and Workday weren't the only companies to provide upbeat news. Other emerging software and infrastructure providers to report better-than-expected results this week included Splunk SPLK , Box BOX , Veeva VEEV , Nutanix NTNX and Anaplan PLAN , which went public last month.Veeva CEO Peter Gassner told investors on Wednesday that demand for his company's health software continues to grow because customers need it to deal with all the complex regulations of the industry, which has more personalized and specialized medicines than ever before.""Complexity is just increasing and now they see, hey, there's a cloud solution that can do the job and that's what's creating the momentum,"" Gassner said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.More From CNBC"

Powell said that interest rates were just below the central bank’s target, which was interpreted as a dovish turn from the “long way off” sentiment he had shared just months ago.This news followed reports that the Turkey 5—an Amazon-coined term for the shopping holiday from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday—witnessed historic sales. Amazon AMZN actually announced that Cyber Monday itself was the single busiest shopping day in the company’s history, while retail trade organization and data firms confirmed that the shopping holidays broke records throughout the industry.A few solid earnings reports, including that of Salesforce CRM kept this positive momentum going. The cloud software giant this week comfortably surpassed earnings estimates and raised its full-year guidance, breathing fresh life into popular tech growth stocks. Earnings were mixed for retailer Dick’s Sporting Goods DKS, however. Dick’s managed to beat bottom-line estimates and raise its outlook, but total revenue and comps disappointed investors.Now, Wall Street’s attention will turn to the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, where U.S. President Trump and Chinese leader Xi will meet to discuss trade tensions between the two nations. The stakes are high for the Trump-Xi meeting, as investors have clearly declared their desire for progress to be made on ending the trade war.Did these trade tensions cause the Fed to turn dovish? Can holiday sales continue to beat expectations? Will Trump and Xi find something to agree on?

CRM,11-29-2018 06:13PM,How salesforcecom inc (NYSE:CRM) Could Add Value To Your Portfolio,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforcecom-inc-nyse-crm-could-111033863.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.As an investor, I look for investments which does not compromise one fundamental factor for another. By this I mean, I look at stocks holistically, from their financial health to their future outlook. In the case of salesforcecom inc (NYSE:CRM), it is a financially-sound company with a strong track record and a excellent future outlook. Below, I’ve touched on some key aspects you should know on a high level. For those interested in digger a bit deeper into my commentary, read the full report on salesforce.com here.CRM is an attractive stock for growth-seeking investors, with an expected earnings growth of 26% in the upcoming year, supported by its outstanding capacity to churn out cash from operating activities, which is predicted to ramp up by 53% next year. This indicates that earnings is driven by top-line activity rather than purely unsustainable cost-reduction initiatives. In the past couple of years, CRM has ramped up its bottom line by over 100%, with its latest earnings level surpassing its average level over the last five years. In addition to beating its historical values, CRM also outperformed its industry, which delivered a growth of 13%. This is an notable feat for the company.With a debt-to-equity ratio of 25%, CRM’s debt level is acceptable. This means that CRM’s capital structure strikes a good balance between low-cost debt funding and maintaining financial flexibility without overly restrictive terms of debt. CRM appears to have made good use of debt, producing operating cash levels of 0.85x total debt in the prior year. This is a strong indication that debt is reasonably met with cash generated.For salesforce.com, I’ve put together three fundamental aspects you should look at:To help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

CRM,11-29-2018 06:13PM,Valuation Finally Has Caught up to Salesforce Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valuation-finally-caught-salesforce-stock-183349471.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Cloud giant Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM) reported robust double-beat-and-raise numbers in its recent third quarter earnings report on Tuesday, 11/28. Yet, despite shares entering the print around 20% off recent highs, Salesforce stock is up just 5% in response to those strong numbers.In other words, despite Salesforce almost entirely refuting the bear thesis regarding slowing growth and compressing margins with strong Q3 numbers and a strong Q4 and FY20 guide, CRM stock is still more than 15% off recent highs.Why? Valuation. Salesforce has always been a great growth company. You know that. I know that. The Street knows that. Everyone knows that. That hasn’t changed over the past several quarters, nor will it change any time soon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe secular themes underpinning this company are just too strong and too pervasive to stop.But, what has changed is valuation and the broader equity backdrop. Rates are going up. The red hot U.S. economy is cooling. A slowing economy amid rising rates isn’t a favorable backdrop for a big growth, rich valuation stock like CRM.Moreover, fundamentals don’t really support a quick rally back to all time highs. Instead, fundamentals say this stock is fairly valued where it’s trading right now.As such, Salesforce stock isn’t a great buy here. It was attractive before earnings. But, after this pop, the long term risk-reward profile seems balanced and upside seems good but not great.For Salesforce, the Q3 ER was yet another double-beat-and-raise quarter which affirmed the company’s long term growth thesis as a company at the heart of the global cloud and data revolutions.For the market, it was a strong report that refuted the slowing growth bear thesis and confirmed that tailwinds in those aforementioned secular growth markets remain robust.Revenue growth once again came in above 20%, continuing what has been a multi-quarter streak of 20%-plus top-line growth. More important, the guide implies this trend will persist for a lot longer.Next quarter, revenues are expected to rise 25%. Next year, they are expected to grow just over 20%. And, management is maintaining its $22 billion revenue target by fiscal 2022, which implies just under 20% revenue growth in fiscal 2021 and 2022.Clearly, CRM’s robust top-line growth narrative remains in tact. Global economic trends are slowing, and rates are rising, which could cause growth to slow even more. But, two markets that should be resilient to this are the data and cloud markets because they are of huge importance to enterprises of all shapes and sizes.Workloads are shifting in bulk to the cloud, and companies are are using data to make informed enterprise decisions. Companies that don’t make these shifts are behind the curve. No one wants to be behind the curve, so demand in these markets should remain robust going forward.Meanwhile, gross margins continue to track gradually higher towards 80%, while operating margins are improving despite big growth-related investments. The long term implication is for margin improvement to persists, and even accelerate as growth slows over the next several years.Overall, CRM’s third quarter report was very good. The fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 guides were also really good. All together, strong numbers and a healthy guide imply that this company’s long term growth narrative remains robust.Despite the strong report, CRM stock is up just 5% as of this writing. A 5% rally on a strong report after a 20% pre-earnings sell-off isn’t all that bullish. The reason for the relatively subdued rally is that around $130, Salesforce stock already is fully valued for robust growth prospects over the next several years.It seems increasingly likely that Salesforce will hit its $22 billion revenue target by fiscal 2022. Thereafter, growth should remain in excess of 15% due to still powerful tailwinds from the cloud and data markets. Overall, this is a company which realistically has $30 billion revenue potential in five years, or by fiscal 2024.Gross margins should continue to track higher towards 80%, while the opex rate should continue to fall back towards 55% thanks to robust revenue growth. That combination implies 25% operating margins in five years. On $30 billion in revenue, and assuming a 20% tax rate and some share dilution from stock comp, that should lead to about $6.50 in EPS by fiscal 2024.Application software stocks usually trade around 30 forward earnings. A 30 forward multiple on $6.50 implies a fiscal 2023 price target of $195. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of just over $130.As such, long term fundamentals imply that Salesforce stock is fairly valued at current levels.Salesforce stock is a long term winner, but valuation concerns remain amid a rising interest rate backdrop. As such, while this stock can and will likely head higher from here, it is unlikely to quickly retake all time high levels.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare BrokersThe post Valuation Finally Has Caught up to Salesforce Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace."

Both the assistant's improving relevance and clients' increasing use of this technology are clear from the sharp growth in predictions Einstein is making every day.Salesforce Co-CEO Marc Benioff explained:I told you Einstein was delivering 3 billion predictions and insights every day in the last quarter. Now, a few months later, we are doing 4 billion Einstein predictions every single day, exceeding our expectations. ... All of our products having Einstein built in that Einstein is at the heart at the customer's success platform, making it more powerful and more capable every day.Salesforce closed its biggest acquisition ever earlier this year, acquiring information technology company MuleSoft in a $6.5 billion deal.Fortunately for investors, the acquisition is off to a running start. Salesforce is already seeing a ""great"" return on its investment for its MuleSoft acquisition, said Salesforce Co-CEO Keith Block.Block continued:And speaking of MuleSoft, integration has become a strategic imperative for all of our customers. It has captured the attention of c-level executives in virtually every conversation I have. ... [I] Just love MuleSoft because MuleSoft is able to unlock data from legacy systems and accelerate their digital transformations.While many of the biggest companies in the world are already using Salesforce's products, there's still more meaningful upside for Salesforce to land more large deals. To this end, Co-CEO Keith Block said that he's met with more than 100 CEOs and world leaders since the end of September -- an initiative that has helped drive ""more strategic relationships than ever.""Block added:In fact, in Q3 the number of deals generating more than $1 million was up 46% over last year. And the number of $20 million plus relationships we have continues to grow significantly.As both Salesforce's third-quarter results and its earnings call show, investors have plenty of reason to expect more strong growth from this tech giant. In addition, strategic acquisitions and the rapid deployment of AI across its business should only fortify Salesforce's leadership position in customer relationship management.More From The Motley FoolDaniel Sparks has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Let's take a closer look at what happened and what this means for both Apple and Cirrus Logic investors.

Pessimism began in July when Facebook provided a bleak outlook for a sharp deceleration in revenue growth and narrowing operating margins during the rest of 2018 and into 2019.

Analyst Elemer Piros reiterated anThree of our Motley Fool contributors think oil-and-gas company MPLX LP (NYSE: MPLX), telecom giant AT&T (NYSE: T), and mortgage real estate investment trust Annaly Capital Management (NYSE: NLY) are top contenders in the world of high-yield stocks. Tyler Crowe (MPLX LP): A stock that has a yield above 7.5% is going to raise several red flags for investors, especially when that stock intends to grow its payout 10% annually. If you look into the financials and business plan for MPLX, though, those concerns about its yield may not carry much weight.There are a lot of reasons why investors might be selling Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock today.

One of the largest SaaS companies in the world, salesforce.com, reported earnings this week that investors were very happy with.Perhaps it shouldn't be too surprising, then, that Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV) -- which focuses on SaaS products for the pharmaceutical industry -- followed suit. The company's cofounder and CEO, Peter Gassner, even had a previous tenure at Salesforce.On virtually every aspect of the release, Veeva looks very healthy.Image source: Getty Images.Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of the company's quarter, let's look at how it performed on the headline numbers.Data source: Veeva IR. *EPS presented on non-GAAP basis.There's a lot to like here. First of all, these results came in well ahead of management's own estimates. Furthermore, it's always a good sign when earnings grow much faster than revenue.A lot of levers helped make this possible. Gross margins for the company's subscription services expanded 350 basis points to an astounding 84.3%. In simpler terms, each additional customer using Veeva's customer relationship management (CRM) and Vault products is costing the company very little to serve.Operating expenses -- research & development, sales and marketing, and administrative costs -- also grew much slower than revenue: 19%, after backing out stock-based compensation. These forces combined to make non-GAAP profit margins expand meaningfully, by over 900 basis points to 31.3%.These results show Veeva is now in the stage of the SaaS model where it is reaping outsize rewards for the infrastructure it has spent years setting up for its customers.Veeva adds so many new services to both its CRM and Vault applications that they can be hard to keep track of. Here's an update on some of the new ones mentioned in Veeva's conference call:Veeva provided an upward revision of its forecast for the fourth quarter. It now expects revenue to come in at a midpoint of $226.5 million, with non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 per share. Those numbers would represent growth of 22% and 74%, respectively.While Gassner was careful to acknowledge that it wasn't an ""official"" forecast, he said he expects Veeva to bring in between $1.0 and $1.1 billion next year. That's a major milestone for the company, and would represent growth of roughly 22%. But investors are likely hoping for even faster earnings growth, as the company has shown it can continue to invest in R&D but still reap outsize rewards from its high-margin SaaS model.More From The Motley FoolBrian Stoffel owns shares of Veeva Systems.

CRM,11-29-2018 06:13PM,Full Steam Ahead for Salesforce?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/full-steam-ahead-salesforce-154011183.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.- By John EngleThe story of San Francisco-based CRM (customer relationship manager) developer Salesforce.com (CRM) has been one of breakneck growth over the last few years, and yesterday's earnings call for the third quarter of 2018 was no exception. The stock opened up 9% on Wednesday morning on the back of a strong report that beat analyst expectations. However, with a price-earnings ratio of around 100, shares certainly look pricey.Does the company's projected growth justify such an expensive valuation, or should value investors keep their distance?FinancialsLet's examine the latest earnings report. Total third quarter revenue was $3.39 billion, up 26% year-on-year and beating consensus estimates by $20 million. Earnings per share came in at 61 cents, beating estimates by 11 cents.This third-quarter outperformance led management to increase revenue guidance for 2019 to between $13.23 billion and $13.24 billion. Management also initiated revenue guidance of between $15.90 billion to $16.00 billion for 2020. This puts Salesforce well on track to reach between $21 billion and $23 billion in 2022, which would make it the fastest-growing software company in history by revenue.War of attritionTaking a deeper look at the report, an eye-catching figure is an attrition rate of below 10%. Attrition, also sometimes called churn, is a measure of customer loyalty. Businesses with high attrition have high customer turnover, meaning that they have trouble retaining clients. This can be due to either poor products, poor customer support or some other issue. As the cost of acquisition of a new customer is estimated to be between five and 10 times the cost of maintaining an existing relationship, high attrition can kill an otherwise well-functioning business.In the mid-2000s, attrition was a serious Achilles' heel for Salesforce, even as it was becoming a leader in the CRM space. Management managed to rein in churn by developing a Customer Success Platform, with dedicated teams to deal with issues and complaints as they arose. The focus on retaining existing customers is a large part of why Salesforce has remained at the front of the pack. Crucially, it takes time to build the brand recognition and trust required for such customer retention, and Salesforce has somewhat of a moat in this area.Product integrationAnother factor in Salesforce's long-term dominance of the CRM market has been the range of services that it is able to provide. As well as being a platform for keeping track of customer accounts, Salesforce integrates very well with a number of widely used business tools. For instance, it has easy integration with Mailchimp, a leading email marketing automation platform. Furthermore, Salesforce allows clients to pick and choose only the services that a business needs. This modular approach means that the company is able to serve both large corporations and small businesses, a point highlighted by Bret Taylor, president of product design, on the earnings call:""Our strategic advantage is that we're the number one in sales, the number one in service, the number one in platform, and the number one in marketing. As you look at Black Friday, I think you can really see where our customers are using every single one of those technologies to transform their customer experience. You might send out a promotion for your Black Friday sales, via a text message or via email in our marketing product. You transact in our Commerce Cloud, you provide service via our Service Cloud. We're the only company that can provide all the solutions in a integrated way. And now with Customer 360, you have a single view of your customer through all the touch points.""VerdictSalesforce is not cheap. But the market for the digital transformation of old-school businesses is enormous, and the company is currently the leader in this space. While the valuation may not be attractive, the long-term growth story here is clear: More and more people are going to require CRMs, and Salesforce will be the one selling to them.(This article was co-authored by Stepan Lavrouk, director of research at Atreides Capital LLC and a former research analyst for Almington Capital Merchant Bankers.)Disclosure: No positions.This article first appeared on GuruFocus."

The decline was primarily attributed to change in revenue reporting, unfavorable currency translation impact and underperformance of SINA’s fin-tech businesses.Revenues from Weibo business grew 43.8% year over year to $460.2 million, primarily driven by robust growth in user base. Non-ad revenues grew 17.7% to $50.9 million and ad and marketing revenues grew 47.9% to $409.3 million in the reported quarter.Portal advertising revenues declined 14.8% year over year to $74.5 million.

Portal non-advertising revenues declined 32.9% to $26.7 million.Mobile app revenues accounted for 79% of total portal ad revenues compared with 63% in the year-ago quarter.

""Despite intensified competition and macro headwinds, we delivered healthy growth in both revenues and profitability driven by the continued momentum of Weibo business.""During the subsequent conference call, CFO Bonnie Yi Zhang credited Weibo's ""robust growth to teams' efforts in product revamp, channel investment, and the content ecosystem cultivation, which further strengthened the social network effect, and broadened our strategic mode to serve public and social interactions among Chinese and the global Chinese communities.""Considering the uncertainties in today's macroeconomic and regulatory environment, SINA now expects full fiscal-year 2018 revenue arriving in the range of 14 billion yuan to 14.2 billion yuan. That's roughly $2.09 billion to $2.12 billion, down from SINA's prior guidance range of $2.12 billion to $2.27 billion.To be fair, Wall Street had already anticipated some weakness; going into the report, consensus estimates predicted SINA's top line this year would arrive at roughly $2.15 billion, well below the midpoint of its old range. In the end, however solid the quarter was, this explains why the stock gave back some of its early gains while still managing to close in the green as investors digested the news.More From The Motley FoolSteve Symington has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

(Operator Instructions) I must advice you that this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, November 28, 2018.I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Ms. Sandra Zhang. Thank you, please go ahead.Sandra Zhang -- Investor Relations ManagerThanks, operator, and hello, everyone. Welcome to SINA's earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2018. Joining us today are our Chairman and CEO, Charles Chao; and our CFO, Bonnie Zhang. This call is also being broadcast on the Internet and is available through our IR website, at ir.sina.com.Now, let me read you the Safe Harbor statement in connection with today's conference call. Our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements, which involve inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. SINA assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements in this call and elsewhere. For detailed discussions with these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 20-F and other filings with the SEC.In addition, I would like to remind you that our discussion today includes non-GAAP measures, which mainly exclude stock-based compensation and certain other items. We use non-GAAP measures to gain a better understanding of SINA's comparative operating results and future prospects. Please refer to our earnings release for more detailed information on reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures.During the call, we may discuss non-GAAP measures for Weibo, which applied the same methodology we used to calculate non-GAAP measures at the SINA Group level. After management remark, we'll open the lines for a brief Q&A session.With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bonnie.Bonnie Yi Zhang -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Sandra. And thank you all for joining our conference call today. Let me walk you through the operational and financial highlights for the third quarter 2018. Before the detailed financial review, I would like to remind you that unless otherwise noted, my prepared remarks would have focused on non-GAAP results and all the comparisons are on a year-over-year basis. In addition, for easy comparison I may also indicate our revenue or expenses figures under the old accounting standard, which excludes barter transaction, adds back value-added tax to the related current period financials.Let's start with an overview of our third quarter results. SINA's net revenue for the third quarter of 2018 was $554.6 million, up 26% or 29% on a constant currency basis. SINA's operating income grew 16% to $168.1 million. Net income attributable to SINA was $67.7 million and the diluted EPS was $0.93. SINA's online advertising revenue for the third quarter of 2018 grew 33% to $483.8 million, primarily driven by an increase of $132.5 million or 48% of growth in Weibo advertising and marketing revenues.Let me provide some color on Weibo's platform growth. As a platform with mobile MAU, over half of the mobile Internet population in China, we will continue to deliver strong user growth and engagement, further solidifying the platform position as the leading social media in China. We attributed the robust growth of the platform to teams efforts in product revamp, channel investment and the content ecosystem cultivation, which further strengthened the social network effect and broadened our strategic mode to serve public and social interactions among Chinese and the global Chinese communities.On top of user growth, Weibo demonstrated and reinforced the unique value proposition for advertisers through a full spectrum of social products -- commercial products, serving advertisers' comprehensive social marketing demands. In the third quarter, the increase in customer number and ARPA continued to be the drivers of ad revenue growth. From an industry perspective, we'll continue to see vitality in Weibo's top key accounts industry with FMCG and 3C growing at a triple-digit rate on an annual basis.The SME sector also delivered healthy growth in Q3 under the recent regulatory changes in few vertical industries, such as gaming and Fintech. We expect these challenges will continue to weigh on the growth prospects of our marketing dollars in the above named industry segments in the foreseeable future.Portal ad revenues were $74.5 million, down 15%, or 10% under the old accounting method, or down 12% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the accounting and unfavorable currency changes, portal business was pressured from ad budget cutback by SME customers, operating in sectors under tightened regulations, such as Fintech. Despite, the regulatory and micro uncertainties, we are pleased to see the resilient advertising performance of few branded industry of portal, such as auto. This was partially attributable to the healthy traffic growth across SINA's mobile media properties, particularly the SINA Finance App with the average DAU growing 214% on an annual basis. On the monetization front, mobile ad revenue continued to grow at a healthy rate, contributing approximately 79% of total portal ad, up from 63% last year.Turning to non-advertising business. Non-ad revenues were $70.8 million, down 8%, or down 2% under the old accounting method. Excluding the accounting change and the negative currency translation impact, the decline was -- resulted from the lackluster Fintech business, due to the regulatory headwind, which was partially offset by the increase in Weibo value-added service.Portal non-ad revenues were $24.1 million, 35% decrease on a year-over-year basis, mainly resulted from the downturn of payment business, because of the sweeping default wave of P2P companies, as we alluded in the prior conference calls. On the other hand, the micro loan facilitation business has returned to the growth trajectory even under the tough comps in Q3 2017, as we launched new Fintech products and upgraded our compliance standards according to the latest government regulation guidelines.Turning to gross margin. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2018 was 80%, up from 76% last year. Advertising gross margin was 82%, up from 77%. The increase in advertising gross margin was mainly a result from our revenue reporting changes from gross basis to net basis under the new accounting standard adopted. Non-advertising gross margin for the third quarter of 2018 was 70%, flat year-over-year.Now, moving on to operating expenses. In the third quarter, operating expenses totaled $276.4 million, up 46%, or 30% under the old accounting standard, year-over-year. Under the old net method, sales and marketing expenses took approximately 26% of SINA's net revenue, up 1% from last year, but dropped 2% sequentially. The slight rise of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was driven by the increase of investment in China marketing on user acquisition of Weibo App, SINA News App and the SINA Finance App. In addition to the sales and marketing expenses, the increase in personnel-related cost was another factor that led to the increase in OpEx.Operating income grew 16% to $168.1 million, representing an operating margin of 30%, down from 33% last year. Non-operating income under GAAP measure was $77.3 million compared to $11.1 million last year. Non-operating income in Q3 included a $50.1 million net gain on sale of investments, fair value changes and impairment on investments, which is excluded under non-GAAP measures, a $17.1 million net interest and other income and a $10.2 million net earnings from equity method investments, mainly resulted from earnings pick-up related to Company's investment in Tian Ge. Please refer to our earnings release for more detailed information about non-operating items for the same period last year.Turning to tax. Under the GAAP measures, income tax expenses were $68.1 million, compared to $24.6 million last year, largely attributable to the deferred tax liability recognized from the fair value changes of certain investments. Net income attributable to SINA was $76.7 million (ph) or $0.93 dilutive net income per share.Now, let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow items. As of September 30, 2018, SINA's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $2.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2017. The decrease of SINA's cash and short-term investments were primarily due to continued investment activities made in the first three quarters, including the payment of land use rights for our headquarter building in Beijing and the execution of share repurchase program in the amount of $228.9 million. For the third quarter 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $100.8 million, capital expenditure totaled $46.8 million and the depreciation and amortization expenses amounted to $9.9 million.Before wrapping up my prepared remarks, I would like to make a note on the Company's fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance. In view of the macroeconomic condition and the regulatory impact, we are revising our fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance to a range of RMB14 billion to RMB14.2 billion, or $2.09 billion to $2.12 billion, assuming US dollar and RMB exchange rate of RMB6.7. The revised revenue guidance represents a year-over-year growth rate of 32% to 34%, reflects a 5% to 7% adjustment to the midpoint of the original revenue guidance we provided at the beginning of 2018.With that, operator, please open up the call.Operator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.Eddie Leung -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGood evening, Charles and Bonnie. Couple of questions. I guess the first one is a more high level. SINA has been in the Internet Industry for quite a while. So just wondering if you could share your thoughts and observations, because on the macro environment we are facing this time versus a couple of macro headwinds in the past, like 2009, as well as, for example, 2012, those times, any differences and similarities?And then secondly, could you also give us an update on the SINA News App? For example, any update on the operating metrics as far as contributions to the portal advertising dollars, that will be great. Thanks.Charles Chao -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay. Eddie, I'll try to answer your first question. That's a tough one. I think actually it's a very good question. I mean over the last 20 years, we have been through several cycles, up and downs and the Internet bubbles and then Internet bubble burst, and then the new opportunities coming from gaming, for SP, and from e-Commerce and then we have mobile Internet. And so there are a few rounds of cycles we've been going through and some of these are impacted by the macroeconomic conditions, some of these are not.But in terms of the impact of macro-economics, I mean -- I think in the past our experience has, if the macroeconomic condition impacted the entire economy, and the Internet industry may not be affected too much, primarily because the entire Internet market is growing, despite of the bad economic conditions on a macro basis and in terms of user growth, in terms of more adoption of different applications and in terms of more time spending on Internet. So when you have this kind of situation, the Internet industry is not so much affected by the macroeconomics. I mean, maybe certain industries like auto, like real estate, these type of vertical areas might be more affected, in terms of advertising dollars for a particular vertical industry. But overall, I think, there's not that much impact. And especially in the economic downturn and when the macroeconomic condition is not very good -- was not very good, people actually tend to turn to Internet for the improvement of efficiency of their own businesses and more effective marketing channels for their products.So overall, I think, in the past, I think the macroeconomic conditions in the down cycle did not have too much impact on the Internet industry. But this time maybe a little bit different, partly because the entire Internet market, in terms of the user growth has kind of stabilized or stagnant a little bit, and in terms of time consuming consumption, Internet is also slowing down in terms of the time spent, I mean, on Internet grows. And so these factors, and not to mention that Internet is already in everybody's life, affecting every industry already.So in that sense, I think, the macroeconomic condition will have more impact this time versus previous round and that's probably where we have seen, in some of the areas, I mean we have been experiencing right now in both SINA portal and Weibo, and especially in some of the areas like travel, for example, like some of that auto service industries and the big-ticket items, like wedding-related expenditures, we have seen some slowing down. That has to do with more macroeconomic conditions. And indirectly, we believe that the conditions also impact the investment in the entire Internet industry as a whole and you have seen significant decline in terms of investments in that particular sector. That actually also indirectly impacts the demand for advertising for lot of the other companies, small companies, trying to driving traffic for their new applications, new Internet services. And this kind of demand also coming down, and so that will have impact indirectly our industry. So this is kind of -- sort of our take in terms of the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our industry as a whole, I mean, for this particular cycle, I guess.And regarding the second question, the News App, I think the News App is an area that our overall marketplace is relatively mature in terms of overall market growth and also in terms of time spent. So people are actually more competing on the time spent on this particular app versus another one, and so the overall growth rate for every app in this sector is quite -- slowing down quite a bit. And for us, we're still growing, but on a much smaller basis in the second half of this year versus -- I'm comparing to the previous first half, or comparing the previous year. But in terms of efficiency, monetization is still growing, but on an overall basis, I mean, given that the trough is not growing that much and given that the demand for advertising is much for SME, I mean is kind of challenging, not only for Weibo, but also for the -- our Internet mobile business. And so we're still going to have some challenges in near future in terms of growing our revenues for SINA mobile, especially for SMEs. Hope I answered your question.Eddie Leung -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThank you.Charles Chao -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please ask your question.Alicia Yap -- Citigroup -- AnalystHi, good evening, Charles and Bonnie. Thanks for taking my questions. I have follow-up questions on the Weibo comment earlier. I think (inaudible) mentioned about the internal investment into the MCN for some of the subsidies, even its -- the slowing macro and the subsidies is also affecting the slower guidance growth. So just wanted to know, roughly, how much of these initiatives, in terms of reinvestment into the MCN is affecting our 4Q guidance slowdown. And then is this actually in line or related to Alibaba strategy, which is also pushing off the monetizations of the recommended feeds, or is it separate feed?And then quickly on the housekeeping questions is that, does the revisions of SINA and also Weibo guidance include any of the (inaudible) contribution in the fourth quarter?Charles Chao -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay, Alicia, let me try to answer your first question. I think these are two separate issues, in terms of internal investment in our KOL and MCNs. I think this is really to try to build a stronger content ecosystem for our Weibo platform, basically. With more KOLs and more MCNs, we are going to see more content being contributed by the big KOLs and also more interactions between our KOLs and our user base. And this has always been our strategy, I mean, for the last whatever years and try to build a strong ecosystem for our KOLs. And our subsidiary really tried to encourage people to actually create more content and that helped then to build bigger social assets on our Weibo platform, so that they can benefit from their strong social assets going forward.And also indirectly, I mean, when these people are building a strong social asset and they have more incentive actually to spend marketing dollars on us, actually, I mean to -- these were the organic drivers for our advertising revenues for our ecosystem. And -- but this has nothing to do really -- I mean, it's more from our perspective to create a stronger content ecosystem, not really directly to our revenue guidance for the first (ph) quarter. And for the first (ph) quarter, I think (inaudible) has already kind of elaborated some of the market conditions, as well as some of the challenges we are facing in the market. Some of these are regulatory related, some of these are macroeconomics related and some of these are competition related and some of these could be our internal related.And there are multiple factors. I mean some of these from demand side, some re from the price side, and that's a mixed picture. Overall, I think it's KA, which seem to be doing very well and has very meaningful strong growth. And SME is a little bit challenging and we can elaborate some of the factors affecting SME. Some of these could be near term, I mean like the regulatory issues related to gaming and these type of things (ph). And some of this could be a little bit longer in terms of the demand side and -- like the travel business, like wedding businesses.But some of supply side issue could be more complicated, because we're having a much competitive market in terms of supplying these kinds of inventories for the mobile advertising. And so, this coupled with the demand side problems, we are facing some of the challenges in SME areas in near future. But overall, I think, that's probably an overall picture. And I think our Company has already elaborated this very well in the previous conference call. And in terms of revision of the guidance, maybe Bonnie can give you some color on that.Bonnie Yi Zhang -- Chief Financial OfficerFor the fourth quarter guidance, we have included our best estimates of the EVE (ph) live broadcasting revenue contribution into the number. So again, it's very preliminary, as we just acquired the team and we are still in the midst of the product conversion period.Alicia Yap -- Citigroup -- AnalystOkay, thank you, Bonnie. Thank you, Charles.Charles Chao -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Karen Chan from Jefferies. Please ask your questions.Karen Chan -- Jefferies -- AnalystThank you, Charles. Thank you. Bonnie, and thank you, Sandra. I have two questions here. First, within our top 5K verticals, including auto, FMCG or finance, which are seeing the most macro impact and particularly for auto OEMs, are we seeing any indication to a pullback in ad spending as these advertisers plan for their 2019 ad budget?Secondly, maybe more a question for Charles. Given the many changes we've seen in the regulatory environment recently, be it mobile games, eCommerce, video, et cetera, just want to get your thoughts on how is this level of participation from regulatory bodies different from the last in any way, and will any of these Internet segments -- or what kind of platforms do you think will show higher resilience when the dust settles? Thank you very much.Charles Chao -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIn terms of the verticals, and historically our top verticals like automobiles, like financials, like FMCG, these are our three top ones and there are smaller ones like eCommerce and maybe the IT products -- yeah, IT products, that's like -- IT products, actually including the mobile phones. And I think the -- currently I think we are seeing, as Godfrey (ph) mentioned in the previous call, some of big-ticket items affecting some of their spending, especially for performance-related advertisement. But in terms of the brand advertising, we are not seeing that much impact so far. And -- for example, for automotive industry, we know that auto sales is going down in the second half of the year on a yearly basis for China market. But we're not seeing that much impact on advertising yet. Obviously, it's not great, but maybe it experienced -- the theory is that when the market is not doing well, the automobile manufacturers actually have more incentive to spend money to push their sales. And in some way they offset some of the impact of the decline in sales for the mobile industry and that some of the market we are observing.In terms of the FMCG, I think it's not that much related to the macro yet, and we're not seeing too much impact from the spending from customers for these kind of industries. And same for IT. So overall, I think, we're not seeing that much impact at the current stage, but the real impact is really for the SME and also for the -- I will say the big customers -- some of the big customers for performance-based advertising, they've actually scaled back quite a bit in certain industries, as we mentioned like travel, like wedding-related, like Fintech, these kind of areas.And in terms of the other question you have, on an overall basis, in terms of regulatory environment, in terms of macro environment, which industry less affected, that's a tough question and I think it's a complicated one, because if we got to pin down a particular industry or particular application, than the one more resilient, on an overall basis if we look at the Internet industry as a whole, although you have a very different product format for different companies, at end of the day most of the companies generate their revenue from advertising. I mean you're right. And some of these are more related to performance-based advertising for Internet service, like a gaming advertising, like eCommerce advertising, like download our apps, these type of things. And some of these relate to the -- I will say, the brand advertising.And then you have another category not (ph) generated revenue from advertising, mainly the content fee-based services, like gaming, like long video these type of things. And these are the major -- sorry the business models, or revenue models for majority of Internet companies. And so if you look at these models, you can easily identify some of these areas, if they're relying on certain revenues and then certain regulatory change and the macroeconomic change will have a great impact on these particular companies who will have particular models, but on an overall basis I think each company will be affected by a slowing down in the advertising business and which -- including the KA business, brand advertising business and the performance-based SME business.And in terms of KA, I mean, as I've said, at the current stage we're not seeing that much impact right now, but maybe it's due to the strength of our platform in terms of delivering service better for our key customers via other platforms. And as you know, we have a pretty robust platform for both Weibo social media and for the News App to provide overall service for advertising customers, for KA customers. But over longer term if macroeconomic continues, if the condition lasts, and I think overall it will eventually hit KA customer base and have impact on the KA advertising. But I think at the current stage, we are seeing actually more challenging environment in the performance-based advertising for SMEs, as I elaborated in the previous question that a lot of these has demand issues and then also we are facing some supply issues, that actually is common for every player in this market.And in the demand side we have a regular impact on the gaming and Fintech, where you have the macroeconomic impact on investment related to travel and these type of industries. And so, these were inventories, I think, hit the market and if you look at the companies who rely much on the performance-based advertising, I think these companies will be more affected on an overall basis. That will be my assessment. Hope that answers your question.Karen Chan -- Jefferies -- AnalystThank you very much. Thank you, Charles. Very helpful.Charles Chao -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the conference back to today's presenter, Ms. Sandra Zhang, please continue.Sandra Zhang -- Investor Relations ManagerThis concludes our conference call today.

SQ,12-03-2018 01:13PM,"5 Top Stock Trades for Tuesday: NFLX, AMD, SQ, QQQ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stock-trades-tuesday-205054746.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Investors had a sigh of relief as the U.S. and China made some progress on the trade front. While it didn’t put an end to the dispute and there’s plenty of negotiating left to do, it signaled that, at least for the immediate future, the trade war won’t escalate. That allowed markets to rally and gave us a whole new set of top stock trades to watch.Before we get too far, let’s zoom out and look more broadly. Specifically, let’s look at the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), which fell more than 16% from peak to trough. That’s a rather notable decline for an ETF such as this.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn any regard, we have shares rallying through the $173 mark and pulling back. That’s significant, as Monday’s move in the QQQ initially put it through the 50-day and the 200-day moving average. It’s been a quick — and doubted — 9.5% rally off the lows. It’s making many investors hesitant to chase as well.From here I want one of two things for the bulls: Either pullback or consolidate in this area and hold the $170 level or rally again over the next few days and then stay above the 50-day/200-day area.The markets already seem a little tired on Monday, so if we get some profit-taking over the next few days, I want to see $170 hold. If it doesn’t, $166 is on deck.Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was uninspiring on Monday, hitting almost $300 per share before falling flat and landing at $285. Ugh. This one has been a defeating one for the bulls.The move isn’t too surprising, given that NFLX failed right at downtrend resistance. As long as it as stays above $270 though, the bulls might be all right.If it does, it will secure a “higher low” and give NFLX more energy to push through that resistance mark. The key to watch is which level gives way first. If it’s $270, the November lows are back in play.Up almost 30% from the lows, many investors are wondering if they missed the train on Square (NYSE:SQ).Like NFLX, shares are running right into downtrend resistance. Bulls can buy a dip down the $68 to $70 level and use a close below $65 as their stop-loss. There’s decent support nearby to warrant a long position for aggressive investors, but below support and things could get ugly.This one is putting money in bulls’ pocket, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares rallying almost 11% on Monday. A week ago, we flagged this trade, and noted several times afterwards that the risk/reward remained appealing.That’s as AMD consolidated above prior downtrend resistance (purple line). As shares now run into the 50-day moving average and $24 level, those who bought may consider booking some or all profits.For those that are letting it ride, I wouldn’t let shares get below $23.Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is moving strong off the lows, but has been weak all year. I own a morsel of the stock for its low valuation and solid growth, but other than that, Celgene has been painful ride.Coming into this $77-ish level, we’ll find out which group — the bulls or the bears — will harness control. This level was support for several months in early summer, but turned to resistance in November. Just above this mark is the 50-day moving average as well. Should Celgene fall — which wouldn’t be a surprise — look to see that the 21-day moving average holds as support. If it doesn’t, the lows are back in play.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long CELG.Compare BrokersThe post 5 Top Stock Trades for Tuesday: NFLX, AMD, SQ, QQQ appeared first on InvestorPlace."
SQ,12-03-2018 10:13AM,3 Financial Stocks to Buy While They’re Cheap,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-financial-stocks-buy-while-183609499.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.This morning stocks are rallying on the back of good news from the G20 meetings. China and the U.S. struck a deal to halt the tariff rhetoric so that they can negotiate a long-term trade deal between the two countries.The fear that the U.S. and China would bog down global growth with tariffs has driven a lot of market volatility this year. There is a lot on the line for all economies and this morning’s news is a relief to the markets.Year-to-date — while not a financial disaster — equities have been under pressure and in see saw from one headline to the other. This is especially disappointing to financial stocks. This year was supposed to be when bank stocks flourished. The U.S. Fed is in a rate hike cycle and the idea was that banks would profit from the higher rates. This hasn’t worked out that way so far. In fact, coming into today the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLF) is down 3% in 2019, lagging behind the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq which are up 4% and 11% respectively.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs a result, bank stocks are now even cheaper, so there is value in most of them, and they should be part of a healthy portfolio.  At some point this general macroeconomic malaise will pass and the sentiment selling will abate. There is a lot to like in these financial stocks and they are worth accumulating.Source: ShutterstockFirst on my list of financial stocks is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). BAC sells at a trailing P/E of 13.6 — a ratio which is cheap in both absolute and relative terms. At these levels, BAC stock sells at almost price-to-book, meaning that investors give it no credit beyond the assets on its books.Buying BAC here is likely very safe. Bank of America has a strong management team. They were able to navigate out of the worst financial disaster and save a few other banks along the way. In short, if the stock markets move higher in the next few years, then BAC stock will too. In addition, it mainly operates in the U.S. so it has little exposure to China headlines.Source: Via SquareMomentum stocks rarely give investors clear entry points. That is the case with Square (NYSE:SQ). Unlike Bank of America stock, SQ stock is far from cheap. But this is a fintech stock so I don’t give the same amount weight to value as I would for a standard financial center. Case in point, even though SQ has fallen 20% in the last three months, it’s still up 80% in 12 months.This is a stock that should to be part of a complete portfolio. SQ has solid fundamentals as it begins to compete with the likes of Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Recently SQ stock was dragged lower by the bitcoin crash. Part of the rise of Square was tied to its foray into the blockchain arena. So like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), SQ suffers on the way down with bitcoin too.Both BAC and SQ are financial stocks technically poised for spikes. They are now re-approaching pivot zones and if the bulls can prevail in retaking them they can shot 7% higher on momentum alone. Since SQ is a fast mover, its breakout will be faster and longer than that of BAC, but they should both do well.Source: ShutterstockLast on my list of financial stocks to buy today is Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) . GS stock has grossly under-performed in absolute terms  and relative to the sector. GS is down 24% in 12 months.Recently Goldman Sachs has been in the news over issues with their potential involvement in the Malaysian bond fraud event. I don’t now how this scenario is going to play out but it’s worth a small bet for a positive resolution. Usually Wall Street is too quick to overreact and it’s too early to call GS stock dead for good. As a result of its massive fall, GS now sells at an 8x forward P/E.Nevertheless, Goldman Sachs stock still carries a high ticket price at $190 per share. So one can use options to speculate on a rebound into the first quarter of 2019 instead of risking the face value of the stock. Options offer lower entry costs for a chance to profit on a rebound. In addition to the fundamental news, GS stock is also at a technical disadvantage. Losing the $220 level triggered a bearish pattern that may still be unfolding. There is further risk below if $185 zone also fails.Click here for more of my market thesis and get an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

SQ,12-03-2018 02:13PM,3 More Stocks That Can Double Again in 2019,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-more-stocks-double-again-220000018.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Don't let anyone tell you that it's been a ho-hum year for investors. A lot of stocks have made some big moves higher this year, and that includes roughly 50 companies with market caps north of $1 billion that have more than doubled in 2018. What if things are just getting started?I took a look at three stocks that can double again in 2019 a couple of weeks ago, but now I have some more names for your consideration. Square (NYSE: SQ), Glu Mobile (NASDAQ: GLUU), and Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) have rewarded investors handsomely in 2018. They could lead the way by repeating the feat in the year ahead.Image source: Square.The high-tech merchant payment processing specialist has been on a tear over the past two years, and if it doubles again in 2019, it will be three years in a row that the stock tops a 100% return. It would be quite the three-peat.It's easy to see why the market has become enamored with Square. It has posted accelerating revenue growth in each of the past seven quarters, a streak that started at a 21% year-over-year top-line increase in the first quarter of 2017, clawing its way up to 51% in its latest quarter. Adjusted revenue is growing even faster, up 68% in the third quarter.Raising the bar with every passing quarter will get more challenging in 2019, largely because of the law of big numbers. However, with its Square platform continuing to woo merchants and its Cash App gaining traction with consumers, it's hard to bet against the market darling until it proves mortal.A hot app can work wonders for a smallish mobile gaming publisher, and Glu Mobile has a knack for coming up with a hit just when a former trendy diversion starts to grow stale with smartphone jockeys. Glu Mobile's latest winner is Design Home, a game where players tap into their inner interior decorator. It's been Glu Mobile's top draw for more than a year, accounting for 41% of its gross bookings in its latest quarter. Covet Fashion and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood were earlier hits that eventually passed the baton to the next sticky app.Glu Mobile's success over the past two years -- it nearly doubled in 2017 -- stems from the conservative guidance that it continues to push higher with every quarterly report. Growth may be slowing at Glu Mobile, but it still isn't at the point where it needs another fresh winner off the bench. Its four largest releases all experienced double-digit percentage bookings growth in its latest quarter. The well at Glu Mobile may eventually run dry, but now it's still gushing with its pulse squarely on what young app players are craving.The leading online marketplace for arts and crafts keeps gaining traction. Revenue surged 41% in its latest blowout quarter, and its adjusted profit more than doubled what Wall Street pros were expecting. Making analysts look like lightweights is just what Etsy has done over the past year when it comes to barreling through bottom-line targets.Data source: Yahoo! Finance.The big catalyst for its recent surge was a decision to boost its selling fees in June, something that could've scared away sellers but, thankfully for investors, that wasn't the case. Etsy's seller base has risen by 8% over the past year with gross merchandise sales climbing 20% in that span of time. It's a win-win-win. Sellers are making more sales. Buyers are finding a broader selection of crafty merchant wares on the site. Investors are cashing in on the explosive margin expansion resulting from the higher fees.More From The Motley FoolRick Munarriz has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

SQ,12-03-2018 09:13AM,3 Hot Stocks to Buy in December,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-hot-stocks-buy-december-131700609.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.It remains to be seen if 2018 will end with a bang or a whimper, but investors keeping close tabs on the market know that it's been a year of ups and downs. Despite the volatility, the S&P 500 is up a modest 3.2% through the first 11 months of the year. It almost seems yawn-worthy, even though investors know that the market hasn't been sleepy at all. There are a lot of stocks getting killed this year. There are also plenty of names that are rocking.Twilio (NYSE: TWLO), SeaWorld Entertainment (NYSE: CVNA), and New Age Beverages (NASDAQ: NBEV) are three stocks pulling off big gains in 2018, up 300%, 110%, and 113% respectively this year. They have more than doubled, but the good news doesn't have to stop here. They're hot stocks, but they still have enough in the tank to keep moving higher in the month ahead.Image source: New Age Beverages.One of this year's biggest winners is the top dog when it comes to in-app communications solutions. The next time that you reset your Hulu password or have a conversation with your Uber Eats driver about the your pad Thai order running late -- without leaving the app -- you're seeing Twilio in action. The cloud-based darling's growing toolbox of app enhancements is the golden standard in mobile apps, and it's why the number of developers leaning on Twilio has soared 31% over the past year.Twilio is killing it, as you can probably imagine from one of the roughly dozen stocks to actually quadruple in 2018. Revenue rose 68% in its latest quarter, blasting through expectations but also continuing a shareholder-lucrative trend of accelerating top-line gains. Momentum is on its side, and now we're knee-deep into the holiday shopping season where Twilio's app magic will continue to deliver the goods.The only major amusement park operator to have its stock more than double this year is SeaWorld Entertainment. We're now five years removed from the Blackfish documentary that made the marine life-themed park operator a popular target for animal rights activists. The boo birds haven't entirely gone away, but we're finally at the point where mainstream audiences have moved on to other causes.Attendance and revenue are rising for the first time since 2013, and we're not just talking about modest upticks. Turnstile clicks are climbing 9% through the first nine months of the year, well ahead of its peers. Revenue is growing even higher. Things should continue to improve in the near term. Larger theme park operators in SeaWorld strongholds in Central Florida and Southern California have been jacking up their admission prices, freeing SeaWorld to follow suit now that it actually has more leverage than desperation in its breath.One of the hottest investing trends in 2018 has been cannabis, as legalization in some form or another continues to open the door of opportunity for companies preparing for the shifting climate in acceptance. New Age Beverages became a bottle rocket in mid-September when it revealed that it would be introducing a line of cannabidiol (CBD)-infused beverages. The stock would go on to soar nearly sixfold at its frenzied peak three weeks later.The stock has given back more than half of its peak gains, but it's getting December off to a strong start by announcing an $85 million deal on Monday to acquire Morinda, a much larger beverage company with $240 million in annual revenue and positive adjusted EBITDA. Morinda and its flagship Tahitian Noni-Juice has a large global footprint with a presence in 60 different countries. The deal should help New Age Beverages piggyback on the wider reach that Morinda brings to the table, giving it a clear path to expand the sales of its existing healthy, natural, and functional beverages. The cannabis angle has helped expand awareness for New Age Beverages' existing lines, and now it has the perfect stepping stone to reach an even larger global audience.More From The Motley FoolRick Munarriz has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Be in 5 Years?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-square-inc-5-years-143000437.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Square (NYSE: SQ) has been one of tech's biggest winners over the past two years. The mobile payments specialist soared 186% last year. The stock is up another 102% in 2018, even after correcting sharply in recent weeks.Momentum has been on Square's side. It has rattled off seven straight quarters of accelerating revenue growth, revving up from a 21% rate to 51% in that span of time. Square has survived the onslaught of tech-savvy rivals and the bitcoin crash of 2018 to deliver scintillating growth. Square is turning heads now, but sustaining the awe isn't easy on Wall Street. Let's see how the next few years will play out, sizing up what Square's prospects may be in 2023.Image source: Square, Inc.There's a meaty asterisk to Square's record third-quarter results. Revenue and adjusted revenue growth may have accelerated during the period, but gross payment volume clocking in 29% higher is Square's weakest year-over-year growth in more than a year.There were a couple of factors padding Square's top-line spurts. Bitcoin revenue that didn't exist a year earlier accounted for a sizable chunk of Square's third-quarter acceleration on the top line. There's also Weebly and Zesty, which beyond likely being rejected Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs names are the the website builder platform and corporate catering company that Square acquired over the past year. All of the accelerating growth isn't a facade. Subscription and services-based revenue would have still more than doubled without the addition of Weebly and Zesty. Hardware revenue is a small part of the revenue mix at Square, but that line item soared 74% on the strength of new payment terminals and card readers.Looking out to 2023, we know what Wall Street pros are modeling. Analysts are targeting $6.6 billion in revenue in five years, more than quadrupling off current levels. They also see Square earning $3.46 a share, an even bigger advance than the projected revenue growth. It's hard to argue that Square's priced cheaply at 20 times earnings five years from now, mostly because we know that reality will likely be far better or far worse than that goal.Square's guidance calls for 45% to 47% in reported revenue growth for the current quarter, possibly the end of an impressive steak of accelerating top-line gains. That's fine. Accelerating growth doesn't last forever. The key for Square's path to keep trouncing the market will be its ability to get merchants to pay more for related services. The more integrated it gets businesses into its ecosystem the harder it will be for them to find a way out. Internally developed offerings and niche acquisitions will dictate Square's success. The stock may not double next year -- or in any of the next five years -- but it has the right ingredients in place to continue beating the market in the long run.More From The Motley FoolRick Munarriz has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

SQ,11-29-2018 06:13PM,These 2 Tech Stocks Look Compelling After Their Big Pullbacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-tech-stocks-look-compelling-235100511.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The overall stock market has been hit pretty hard recently. But many tech stocks have taken a worse beating, evident by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite's 9% decline since Oct. 1 versus the more evenly weighted S&P 500's 6% pullback in the same period. While some tech stocks may have been due for a correction, the decline for two prominent companies might have gone too far.These stocks are Square (NYSE: SQ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which have dropped 28% and 21%, respectively, since Oct. 1. For opportunistic investors, this may be a great time to buy.Square Register. Image source: Square.Shares of financial technology company Square have been absolutely slammed recently. With that 28% drop since Oct. 1, Square has lost nearly a third of its value. The bearish narrative around the stock extends beyond the broader-market pullback in tech stocks. The company's stock also sank when news broke that Square CFO Sarah Friar said she planned to become CEO of Nextdoor (a social network for neighbors and communities) and when management provided a worse-than-expected outlook for fourth-quarter profits.Though Square's stock has been in decline recently, its business has been thriving. Indeed, the company just posted is sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. In Square's third quarter, it surged 51% year over year -- up from 48% growth in Q2. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation jumped 107% year over year to $71 million.For investors looking to hold for the long haul, this could be a good time to pick up some shares of this fast-growing company.Apple's stock has similarly been plagued recently by more than a tech sell-off. Numerous reports of worse-than-expected demand for the company's latest iPhones have weighed on it as investors wonder whether its most important business segment can keep growing.In Apple's most recent quarter, iPhone revenue surged 29% year over year. But this quarter primarily represents the last full quarter of the iPhone X and iPhone 8 cycle; the iPhone XS wasn't released until the last few weeks of the quarter. Investors are worried that the latest iPhones won't be able to live up to tough year-ago comparisons. And Apple's guidance for total revenue to rise only 1% to 5% shows that even management expects the company's growth to slow.But the stock's decline has priced in these concerns. Shares trade with a P/E of just 15. While a further decline is always possible, investors who buy at this level likely won't regret it a few years from now.More From The Motley FoolDaniel Sparks owns shares of Apple and Square.

SQ,11-29-2018 06:13PM,"Even If the Economy Doesn’t Turn, Square Stock Still Has a Problem",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/even-economy-doesn-t-turn-180129274.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The decline in Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has been swift and painful. Square stock has dropped by over one-third from early October highs. At one point, SQ stock had dropped 45% in just seven weeks.The decline really isn’t all that surprising, either. SQ stock seems like the quintessential bull market stock. Indeed, at those October highs, Square had almost tripled in 2018 and traded at roughly 25 times the company’s 2018 adjusted revenue guidance. (Not profits; revenue.)Even with the sell-off, Square stock isn’t close to cheap, as Will Healy pointed out this week. And its cyclical risk isn’t close to priced in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite the valuation, there’s a bull case for SQ stock, though I argued it was overvalued at ~$75 back in August. But investors need to trust the company and get some help from the broader economy. That still seems too narrow a path.At the end of a bull market, investors tend to ignore risk. They forget about economic cycles, for instance.Much of the broad market sell-off of late seems to be a response to increasing evidence that the cycle might turn and Square isn’t the only victim. Homebuilders like Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) have been hammered, as have construction suppliers and distributors.Semiconductor stocks, historically a highly cyclical group, have tumbled, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) nearly halved and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) off 39%. Investors there started to believe the industry could grow forever only to be disappointed.SQ stock seems to fit firmly into that pattern. While the company is moving toward acquiring larger customers, it’s still heavily weighted toward small businesses. And it’s that group that is most heavily at risk during an economic recession as was proven during the financial crisis. Fellow tech play Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has a similar potential problem.Square’s revenue could take a big hit when the macro cycle turns. And it appears the company, too, may have forgotten about the cycle. The company aggressively moved into lending this year just as interest rates were rising.As Ian Bezek detailed in October, treating Square stock like a bank stock suggests huge potential downside. The more risk Square takes on, the more likely investors will be to price that risk in.Clearly even down 35% from the highs, Square has more room for downside, particularly if the cycle here turns.Small business struggles will hurt both credit card receipts (of which Square gets a fee) and potentially pressure its lending business. And it likely will lead to further multiple compression for SQ stock which, as noted, isn’t cheap.If the economy holds up or if Square’s model is just that good, there’s potentially room for upside, but I’m skeptical SQ is the right play.SHOP stock is cheaper on a revenue and earnings basis. There is no shortage of contrarian plays in housing, semis, and industrials. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) looks like an intriguing bet on a tech rebound.Even other, more established, lenders like Enova International (NYSE:ENVA) to OneMain Financial (NYSE:OMF) have seen their valuations come in.In that context, it’s simply tough to choose Square stock as the “buy the dip” candidate. Yes, the dip has been particularly large. But at 12x+ next year’s revenue estimates, and something close to 60x 2019 EBITDA, the valuation remains particularly high.And there’s still plenty of room for SQ stock to drop further, particularly if the cycle turns against it.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.Compare BrokersThe post Even If the Economy Doesn’t Turn, Square Stock Still Has a Problem appeared first on InvestorPlace."
SQ,11-29-2018 06:13PM,Square Stock Looks Solid as Earnings Stabilize,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-stock-looks-solid-earnings-171828565.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Square (NYSE:SQ) has become the magic device of farmers’ markets and small businesses across the country — and the world. And that has been a boon to SQ stock.Historically credit card processors have not been cool, but that was before the age of mobile hit and the technology began to unleash the power of phones, tablets and laptops as cash registers.While there is certainly significant competition in this space from big players in the credit card space, SQ stock got its start by enabling small businesses to accept forms of payment beyond cash without having to buy a huge amount of equipment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt’s no surprise Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), also founded and runs SQ.And even after getting pelted in a 25% loss in the past three months, SQ stock is still up an impressive 90% year to date.There’s no doubt that the coming months will be a tougher slog for non-cash payment processors like Square as consumers slow their spending into next year.But this short-term issue has already been priced into the stock at this point — at least a good amount of it. If the economy slows in 2019 but doesn’t collapse into recession, SQ stock has a very good environment to continue its growth long term.When markets correct like this, especially specific sectors, it’s a good time to look at specific stocks and see whether the hits they took make them better buys or better sells. At this point, Square falls in the former camp.The reality is, mobile payments and cashless payments are becoming the norm, not just in the U.S., but around the world. The financial institutions prefer it (it’s cheaper for them not to have to deal with cash), the card companies prefer it (more revenue) and consumers seem to be getting on board.And even if the consumers are hesitant, when most of the financial world wants something, they’ll find a way to use a carrot or a stick to get their customers in line with their desires.The real challenge for SQ stock is staying competitive and growing its base. Just as TWTR is just figuring out how to grow its base — and more importantly, monetize it — so Square has to figure out how to grow beyond its core audience.But here, the good news is its global presence in Asia and Europe can help boost its fortunes. Also, SQ stock continues to expand its systems so it can accept more forms of payment on more platforms. And it’s also offering point-of-sale products as well as financial and marketing services for its clients.All this opportunity is balanced with the reality that this is a dynamic space and Square has to navigate some real competition. But given its focus on a sector that big players aren’t used to attracting and smaller players don’t have the breadth to lend much value, it has a very good chance of solid growth for years to come for patient investors.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

SQ,11-29-2018 06:13PM,Will Bitcoins' Meltdown Hurt Square's Growth?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoins-apos-meltdown-hurt-square-152231957.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Square (NYSE: SQ) added the ability to trade bitcoins on its Cash App in early 2018. It seemed like a lucrative growth strategy at the time, since investors were boosting the price of bitcoins to historic highs.However, the bubble subsequently popped, and bitcoins' price plunged about 80%. Will that meltdown hurt Square's core business of online payments and business services? Let's dig deeper into its fledgling bitcoin business to find out.Image source: Getty Images.Square's core hardware products and software services target business customers. Its main play on the consumer market is the Cash App, which is one of the top three peer-to-peer mobile payment apps in America, alongside Zelle and Paypal Holdings' (NASDAQ: PYPL) Venmo. Square also tethers users to that platform with a physical debit card called the Cash Card.The growth of the Cash App -- along with its Instant Deposit service, Caviar food delivery platform, and Square Capital financing arm -- supports the growth of Square's higher-margin subscription and services revenue, which surged 155% annually last quarter and accounted for 19% of its GAAP (generally accepted accounting principle) revenues.Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell estimates that Square's services could generate nearly half its revenues next year. The expansion of those services -- which also help companies manage payrolls, inventories, customer data, websites, and more -- would boost Square's revenues per customer, lock them into its ecosystem, and widen its moat against its rivals.Square's introduction of bitcoin transactions to the Cash App gave it a unique competitive edge against Venmo and Zelle, since neither rival app offered the feature. Bitcoin trades could also complement Square's upcoming moves into the personal finance space -- which could include savings accounts and stock trades for Cash users in the near future. Simply put, Square wants Cash to evolve into an all-in-one finance app for digital transactions -- and maintaining a foothold in the crypto market seems like a smart move.Image source: Getty Images.Square buys bitcoins for its Cash users, then adds a slight margin to the purchase price but doesn't charge additional transaction fees. Users are allowed to buy up to $10,000 in bitcoins per week, but there aren't any limits on selling.Square notably excludes its bitcoin- and transaction-based costs from its adjusted (non-GAAP) revenues. To calculate the profits Square generates from bitcoin sales, we simply subtract its bitcoin costs from its bitcoin revenues:Financial MetricQ1 2018Q2 2018Q3 2018Bitcoin revenues$34.10 million$37.02 million$42.96 millionBitcoin costs$33.87 million$36.60 million$42.41 millionBitcoin profits$223,000$420,000$555,000Source: Square quarterly reports.Square's bitcoin revenues accounted for just 5% of its GAAP revenues last quarter, and the profits accounted for only 3% of its GAAP profits (which turned positive after the Eventbrite (NYSE: EB) IPO earlier this year). Those percentages are low, but Square's bitcoin revenues and profits are still steadily climbing on a sequential basis -- even as bitcoins' market price crumbles.That's because Square merely acts as a bitcoin exchange instead of actually being invested in the cryptocurrency. In other words, more trades in a volatile market could boost Square's bitcoin revenues and profits more than a complacent one, regardless of the market price. Therefore, bitcoins' ongoing meltdown shouldn't have any impact on Square's long-term growth. In a worst-case scenario, Square would simply buy fewer bitcoins as its Cash users stop trading the cryptocurrency.Square CEO Jack Dorsey claimed that bitcoins could become the world's ""single currency"" in an interview with The Times of London earlier this year. However, Square's future isn't dependent on bitcoins -- it's merely using them as a way to widen Cash's moat against the bank network-backed Zelle and PayPal's Venmo. Cash's cumulative downloads surpassed Venmo's earlier this year, according to Sensor Tower and Nomura Instinet, which indicates that Square has a clear shot at hurting PayPal in the peer-to-peer payments space. There are certainly reasons to be cautious about Square's high-flying stock -- but tumbling bitcoin prices aren't one of them.More From The Motley FoolLeo Sun owns shares of Square.

SQ,11-27-2018 06:13PM,Square (SQ) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-sq-stock-sinks-market-224510988.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.In the latest trading session, Square (SQ) closed at $65.88, marking a -0.96% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.33% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.44%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.01%.Coming into today, shares of the mobile payments services provider had lost 1.13% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 1.56%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.89%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from SQ as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 26, 2019. In that report, analysts expect SQ to post earnings of $0.13 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 62.5%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $910.57 million, up 47.81% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $0.46 per share and revenue of $3.26 billion. These totals would mark changes of +70.37% and +47.4%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for SQ should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends.

The interview took place at CNBC's inaugural tech conference, East Tech West, in Nansha, Guangzhou.GC: Thanks, last but not least, as they always say, thank you so much, Mandy, for that, and Jane, terrific to have the opportunity-,JS: Thank you.GC: To talk with you again. We've had some really interesting conversations up here, both with people at the very early stage of the road that your company has travelled, and some a little bit further down the road. What's becoming clear, it seems, is that the investing environment has become a little bit more difficult-,JS: Mm.GC: At the VC, private equity level. I wonder if you could just offer us some reflections on some of the challenges, as you see it, for perhaps other companies in your space, at the moment, trying to get a foothold? I mean, maybe that's a good news story, for CTrip, in a way-,JS: Yes, yes.GC: But just explain how you see the travel and leisure sector.JS: Yes. For travelers, I think the segment we are targeted at is relatively resilient, so we are targeting at people who are making $10,000 USD per person, and that segment, relatively, is more resilient than the people making less money. So, what we have seen is safety is very important for these travelers. Secondly, the direct flight routes is very important. Whenever the airlines open a direct flight, we can see the increase to these countries or cities. Thirdly, the people who want to go to Europe, or Australia and New Zealand, or Asia, I think they all want to feel-, to be welcomed, and that feeling is also very important. So, whenever I travel around the world, when I see these cities, meeting with the state governors, I always try to make sure, if they have the will to receive more tourists, they have these three things in mind. And we also designed a program called Welcome China program, so Chinese customers, on the first couple of days, they are very daring to try different food, but after a couple of days, they will miss their food, they like to have hot teas, you know, little things will be very important. The road signs, if they have a little Chinese on it, so they feel, 'Oh!' very comfortable, that's all very comf- very, very well.GC: So, all of those things are about tailoring the specific-,JS: Yeah.GC: Experience to the Chinese traveler-,JS: Exactly.GC: But just circling back to my first question, there is a sense that the Chinese economy is slowing, at the moment, and the middle class traveler, who is just emerging, in many senses, has less disposable income-,JS: Mm.GC: To spend on your experiences. Are you seeing any of that, in all the data you collect, and what does that mean, in terms of maybe profitability and margin for you?JS: Yes. So, for us, I think, if we look at our Diamond users, no impact at all. If we look at the new, upcoming, young people, instead of travelling for example, abroad, now they are travelling domestic. And for certain countries, if the currency trades against RMB negatively, then these regions will be impacted. But if the Chinese dollar is holding against certain currencies at a steady level, it's not impacted.GC: One of the reasons it's so good to have you here is you are a big user of data-,JS: Yes.GC: And you've invested heavily in systems that allow you to mine, and use that data to react very quickly to trends.JS: Mm.GC: Can you give us a sense of just how quickly you're able to change the pricing of what you're offering, a hotel package, perhaps, or a flight plus a hotel, based on the feedback you're receiving? How quickly does that process happen?JS: Oh, that's instant. So, we connect with all the hotels, every day we host about-, we have about 300 million registered users. Based on where the customers are, we try to reach out to the suppliers, and find the best rate for our customers. And we also innovate a lot of new products. So, for example, China right now has two thirds of the high-speed railway, and the speed is 50% faster than the rest of the world, yet the price is one half of the price we have in Europe. So that gives a huge potential. So, CTrip innovated this product called High-speed Railway Package, so along the way, when you travel, for example, we went to the Hollywood of China, where all these movies were filmed, it used to take 4.5 hours, now we can get there by 1.5 hours. So we, you know, were able to negotiate a very good deal with the hotels, and bundle it together, we negotiated very good deals with the attraction tickets, bundle it together. So, that is something that, based on what data, we saw our customer has the need, we reached out to the vendors, and were able, using our huge volume, to negotiate a very good deal for our customers.GC: Now, you've made investments overseas, and international expansion, I think, is one of your key objectives for next year. How frustrated are you that you don't have the access to the same kind of data, or that actually, the infrastructure or the setup reacts very differently to how you expect it to behave, based on your experience here?JS: Mm. Yes, we made a very good investment-, two very good investments, in UK companies. One is Skyscanner, they have about 200 million users, MAU, so their data is very important for us, and the brand is very strong, their strength is in Europe and the rest of the world, so we collaborate very closely. Before CTrip made the investment, Skyscanner is a price comparison engine, where it compares all the prices, but when you select one vendor, it will take you to the other website. Now, in the PC world, that model works, but in the app world, the user's experience is not the best. So, what we do is we insert our direct booking facility on their website. If you select Trip.com, which is our brand outside of China, you will be able to fulfil everything within their sites, to the conversion rate increases, and we are able to cross-sell hotels, etc. So it has been a very successful initiative on our side, and so we will leverage their knowledge. Another investment we made is called Travelfusion, it's a B2B small company, but they are a traffic hub for low-cost carriers. Again, before CTrip made the investment, the growth probably was somewhere around 10 to 20%. But after we made the investment, every year, they enjoy 50% growth, because the volume CTrip brings them is just tremendous, the margin is very high. So that's the type of synergy we would like to see, one plus four equals to five.GC: There's a very big focus, at the moment, on privacy, and data usage, and some companies in the west are under a lot of pressure, like Google, and Facebook, and so forth. Since you're a Chinese company in the technology space that's already been able to make the leap, and access data in the UK, could you share, perhaps, some of the challenges, and some of the frustrations, and how you've had to modify your approach-,JS: Mm.GC: To fit in with different data privacy regulations?JS: Yes. We are quite young, in terms of our globalization, so in a way, it's good, because we are very small, in portion, so we try very hard to stay in compliance with all the rules and the regulations. But I think, again, the big players in our portfolio are the companies we've invested in already, in Europe, in North America, etc. And these companies, they have the experience, how to work with the regulators, and make sure they stay in compliance.GC: Which is a very interesting example, because people in the western business field have complained that they feel they need to partner, to come in to the Chinese market. What you're saying is actually you were pleased to partner, going in to the western markets-,JS: Yes, yes.GC: Because it got you up to speed very quickly.JS: Yes. Exactly. I think, in a way, globalization is scaling your technology on the backend, so all your sourcing, hotels is shared by the global customers, but in terms of user interface, UI design, language, service, marketing, these are very localization. So, in a way, part of the globalization strategy is a localization strategy, so it's very important for us to work with the local experts.GC: As you look at 2019, I've talked about your international strategy, but what else are your key deliverables? What are you planning for next year?JS: Mm. Yes. I think we have two fields, two tremendous growth ahead of us. First of all, within China-, although CTrip is a very dominant player in China, we still only account for maybe 7 to 8% of the overall travel market, and that market is, you know, if we are talking about GDP growth rate at 6%, the industry is worth double that, to grow at about 10%, and CTrip normally can double that number. So we are looking at a very fast growth still, within China, so to further penetrate in to the area where the GDP growth per capita is growing will be very important for our domestic team. The second thing is, also, because China is so huge, we have 1.3 targeted audience ahead of us, so we've hired 8,000 engineers to develop a network originally designed to be utilized by Chinese customers, but if Chinese customers can use it, why can people in Korea not use it? Why can people in Singapore not use it? Right? So, that network is very scalable, so our task is making sure the great assets we've built is not only limited by utilizing by Chinese customers, but also we are able to let in customers outside of China to use that network.GC: Something that I know you've been talking about, and looking at, is smart hotels.JS: Mm.GC: What innovations, including smart hotels, are the traveling public going to see, in the next few years, that maybe they don't know about yet?JS: Yes. I think smart hotel, it has many different stages, different phases. So, for example, we have worked on facial recognition, so if facial recognition is done, you can automatically check in. And on the phone, we have a smart key, so on the key, you can turn on your air conditioning, and you can get in very easily. And a lot of people also say, 'Oh, if the robotic technology takes over, maybe we can use robots to carry out luggage to our home, and I think this will happen, because the labor cost inevitably will increase. Using machines to do something that is logic, that is programmable, is a very feasible way to make sure the customer is satisfied, and efficiency is improved.GC: Do you find that the Chinese market is more willing to accept this technology than other markets you operate in? Give us a sense of where you find the take-up easier.JS: Yes. I think, for CTrip, we have 50% of our customers younger than 35 years old-, oh, 70% is younger than. So that number is very big. And Chinese people are very innovative. They like to try. I think an ideal hotel room, in our young people's mind, will be a Star Wars hotel, or something, you know, you have little-, you know, a futuristic theme designed in it. I think that will all happen. I think wherever you see a desire, there will be a need, there will be an opportunity.GC: Tell us something that people don't know about CTrip. I think your company is well recognized in this marketplace, and you're very well known, as a pioneer in this area. But perhaps share with our audience something they won't have heard anywhere else, either about you, or about the business, that isn't commonly known.JS: Mm. CTrip is not only an online company. I always tell our young employees, with an average age of 25 to 26 years old, that their mission is not only to issue a ticket, or booking a hotel room. Rather, when they do that, they are linking the world together. So, in Chinese, it's always better to travel 10,000 miles than to read 10,000 books. While we are sending people to the world, bringing people to China, we hope we can promote global peace, promote international peace, and I think, at this moment, it becomes very critical, for the benefits for the global people. The second thing we feel very proud of is, since I am the only (female) CEO in the high-tech industry in China, I feel tremendous responsibility to bring up the female leaders in the company, so we have adopted many policies that are very encouraging and inspiring. For example, when we still were under the one-child policy, our employees, when they had the second child, they would pay a fine, so I would authorize a no-interest loan, for employees to pay off the fine. And now we have a two-child policy, but we still think we should do more. So what we do is, for a lady who is pregnant, we give them taxis for free. When the baby is born, we give them 800 as a welcome gift, 3,000 as education fee. When a female comes back to work, we offer flexible hours. And now we start to hire lots of people who have degrees in both countries, and they are a little bit-, they spend more time in college. So instead of having the female workers to struggle, 'Should I start a family first, or should I work first?' if they decide to have their eggs frozen, CTrip will pay for that, and that is very progressive, and our female employees really enjoy the policies, I think, that give them good options, so they don't have to fight when they make their choice. So, I hope, with all these progressive policies, we will – with the government, and with the enterprise, with the individual families – we will solve the population issue, by contributing our part to China.GC: Jane, thank you so much for being with us. It's been-,JS: Thank you.GC: A real pleasure, listening to how you're going to model the company, going forward. Thank you.JS: Thank you so much for having me.

CTRP,11-27-2018 06:14PM,8 China Stocks With Long-Term Upside,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-china-stocks-long-term-201637064.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The recent U.S. stock market rout started in early October. But many months before U.S. stocks started falling off a cliff, China stocks were dropping into correction territory.The rationale behind the selloff in China stocks is pretty straightforward. The China economy has been flashing warning signs of cooling off for several months, while the U.S. dollar has concurrently strengthened. Amid this economic slowdown and U.S. dollar uptick, U.S. and China trade tensions have not improved, and the probability of bigger and more wide-sweeping tariffs coming in 2019 is now quite high. Bigger tariffs could accentuate China’s economic slowdown, and this will inevitably result in slower growth numbers across all of China’s big companies.This is the mindset investors have taken with China stocks over the past several months. It’s quite bearish. But, it isn’t wrong, either. China’s economy is slowing, and tariffs could slow things down even more. As such, the near term outlook for China stocks is fairly bearish.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut while the near-term outlook is bearish, the long-term outlook is bullish.In the big picture, this is still a country with over a billion people, most of whom are rapidly urbanizing and digitizing. GDP growth is still in excess of 6%, while household income and expenditures per capita still remain a fraction of what they are in the U.S. Long term, the consumer landscape of China will increasingly look like the consumer landscape in America, implying that big growth is here to stay for the next several years. As this urbanization narrative matures over the next several years, China stocks should bounce back.With that in mind, here’s a list of eight China stocks with exposure to all of China’s most promising growth themes, making these stocks the most likely to rally in a big way once near term risks pass.Source: ShutterstockAt the top of this list is China’s most well-known and biggest tech company, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).For all intents and purposes, Alibaba is the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China. They have a huge and rapidly growing e-commerce business. They also have a huge and rapidly growing cloud business. There is also a big-growth digital advertising business, a rapidly expanding offline retail business and a still-developing AI businesses. All together, both companies have consistently exhibited 20%-plus revenue growth.There’s just three big differences between the fundamentals of Amazon and the fundamentals of Alibaba. One, Alibaba is far more profitable. Alibaba’s operating margins are around 20%. Amazon’s are near 5%. Two, Alibaba is growing way faster. Alibaba’s revenue growth was in excess of 50% last quarter. Amazon’s was below 30%. Three, Alibaba stock is way cheaper. Alibaba stock trades at under 30X forward earnings. Amazon stock trades at 80X forward earnings.The big reason Alibaba stock is way cheaper has two parts. First, Alibaba is cheaper because of near-term headline risks inherent to the Chinese economy — but eventually, these headline risks will pass. Second, Alibaba is cheaper because margins are compressing, not expanding. Margin compression is a temporary phenomena sparked by big growth-related investments that will pass with time.As such, the headwinds keeping Alibaba stock are short-sighted in nature, while the tailwinds are long-running. This makes Alibaba stock a likely candidate for a big bounce once U.S. and China trade relations improve.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrSecond on this list is Alibaba’s competitor and China’s second biggest e-retailer, JD (NASDAQ:JD).Much like Alibaba, JD is a hyper-growth tech giant powered by a rapidly growing e-commerce business. Also much like Alibaba, the big problem with JD is slowing revenue growth and margin compression against the backdrop of a Chinese economy that is rapidly cooling. Last quarter’s 25% revenue growth rate pales in comparison to the year ago quarter’s 40% growth rate, while operating margins are down 90 basis points year-to-date to a measly 0.5%.Until revenue growth or margin expansion trends turn around, JD stock won’t rebound.Fortunately, they should be able to turn around. Slower growth recently is a reflection of economic uncertainty in China due to strained trade relations. Eventually, those trade relations will improve, and when they do, JD’s revenue growth should bounce back. Plus, growth should get a big lift as the company expands internationally into new markets.Moreover, much like at Alibaba, margin compression at JD is a temporary phenomena driven by growth-related investments that will inevitably phase out over time.Thus, in the big picture, JD is just fine. The bull thesis is predicated on valuation. At current levels, JD stock is trading at less than 0.5X trailing sales. That multiple strongly implies continued revenue growth deceleration and continued margin compression. From this perspective, the current valuation on JD gives this China stock ample room to run higher when revenue growth and margin trends reverse course.Source: ShutterstockNext up on this list is the company which many consider to be the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of China, Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).Much like the other stocks on this list, WB stock has dropped due to a combination of slowing growth, trade risks, and margin headwinds. But, also much like other stocks on this list, these headwinds are temporary, while the company’s tailwinds are robust and long running.The long term fundamentals underlying Weibo stock are quite promising. You have a red hot social media company that has 430 million monthly active users and is consistently adding about 20 million new users every quarter. You have revenue growth that was in excess of 60% last quarter. Also, margins are stable year-over-year.This growth isn’t going anywhere any time soon. Weibo has generated just $1.5 billion in trailing twelve month revenues on 430 million users. Its U.S. comp, Twitter, has generated nearly twice as much on 100 million fewer users. When all is said and done and the China and U.S. digital ad landscapes are both mature, there is no reason why Wiebo’s users should generate less revenue than Twitter’s users. Thus, Weibo has a tremendous runway ahead to scale ARPU to Twitter levels.This robust unit growth potential on top of consistent user growth will power continued 20%-plus revenue growth for many years to come. Meanwhile, margins should at worst remain stable, and more realistically grow with robust revenue growth. That implies something to the tune of 20% to 30% earnings growth over the next several years.WB stock trades at just 18X forward earnings. Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) trades at a slightly higher multiple. That makes no sense.Source: ShutterstockAnother China stock with hulking long-term upside is live streaming and social media company Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO).Momo is a really good company doing innovative things in a really good space. Momo’s business most closely resembles Tinder, as the platform is designed to be a couples and friends match-making service. This is a good space to be in. It runs parallel to the whole social media growth narrative playing out in China, but also evades competition because it is niche and designed for a purpose unmet by other Chinese social platforms.But, Momo is much more than just China’s Tinder. The company is a leader in China’s booming live-streaming market. To be sure, growth in this market is decelerating and the Chinese government is starting to step in and crack down. But mobile phone penetration and usage is only going up from here, and with it goes mobile video consumption and live-streaming. As Elijah Whaley, CMO of ParkLu, which manages Chinese live-streaming stars, observed: “Mass programming cannot satisfy niche interests.”Overall, the growth narrative at Momo is not broken. Recent numbers affirm this. Q2 was a clean double-beat-and-raise quarter for Momo that comprised nearly 60% revenue growth and 90% profit growth.Like many China stocks, the bull thesis on MOMO stock is predicated on valuation. Despite continued strong numbers, Momo has sold off in sympathy with other China stocks. Consequently, MOMO stock now trades at just 13X forward earnings. That multiple makes no sense next to 90% profit growth last quarter, nor next to the company’s strong growth fundamentals in China’s still rapidly growing digital economy. As such, once near-term headline risks pass, MOMO stock could bounce back in a big way.Source: Thomas Galvez via FlickrA list of China stocks with long-term upside would be incomplete without including China’s go-to online travel site, Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP).Often referred to as the Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) of China, Ctrip was a big winner for the better part of the past decade thanks to a boom in China air travel. As China consumers have urbanized and earned more, they have naturally wanted to travel more and spend those new dollars seeing the world. As such, the narrative at Ctrip has been one characterized by robust and consistent top and bottom line growth.This narrative is slowing now. Last quarter, revenue growth was just 20%. In the year ago quarter, it was over 40%. Moreover, revenue growth next quarter is expected to be below 20%. This slowdown can be attributed to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty in China, and will persist so long as such uncertainty remains.But, that uncertainty won’t remain forever, and the long-term fundamentals here are really good. Just 7% of Chinese citizens have a passport. That is really low. In America, that figure stands closer to 40%. Moreover, Chinese tourists made just 145 million overseas visits last year, which equates to just 10% of the total population. Because of this, the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute (COTRI) predicts that overseas trips will grow from 145 million last year, to over 400 million by 2030.Naturally, as this growth narrative plays out, CTRP stock will be a big winner. As such, once near-term headline risks pass, CTRP stock should grow alongside a still burgeoning China air travel growth narrative.Source: ShutterstockChinese digital search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has not been spared in the recent China stock market rout. The stock peaked in May 2018 at over $280. Since then, BIDU has dropped more than 35% to $180.Much like the other stocks on this list, Baidu has been hampered by a combination of headwinds. Revenue growth is slowing. Margins are under pressure. Forward growth estimates are coming down. Analysts are growing increasingly pessimistic.But, beyond the noise, the long term fundamentals supporting Baidu stock are still pretty strong. Baidu is China’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and as China’s Google, Baidu provides the backbone for China’s internet. Beyond that, Baidu has high-growth cloud, IoT, and AI businesses, the sum of which are still in the early stages of a multiyear growth narrative.All together, so long as internet usage continues to rise in China and enterprise investment into things like cloud and AI continues to grow, Baidu’s growth fundamentals should remain strong. That is a promising read. But, the big concern here is margin compression (operating margins were down 500 basis points last quarter). Until those margins reverse course, BIDU stock won’t bounce back.Margins should bounce back in the medium to long term. Over the next several years, digital advertising, AI, IoT and cloud growth will likely power 15%-20% revenue growth at Baidu. During that stretch, it will be tough for expenses to keep up with revenue. Right now, Baidu is being weighed by huge losses at iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) and big investments into the app ecosystem. Eventually, iQiyi’s margins will improve with scale, and big investments into apps will scale back once the app ecosystem is fully fleshed out. When that happens, these big expenses dragging margins down will phase out, and margins will ramp higher on a much bigger revenue base.Thus, BIDU stock has big bounce back potential at current levels. The stock won’t realize that potential until margins stabilize and/or the trade situation improves. But, these aren’t a matter of “if.” They are a matter of “when.”Source: ShutterstockChinese internet giant Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has had an especially tough 2018. Tencent stock peaked in January 2018 at over $60, and now trades below $40.The big problem here is revenue deceleration. Margins are compressing, but they’ve been compressing for the past several years. In early 2015, TCEHY had 60%-plus gross margins and 40%-plus operating margins. Big investments and a shift to lower-margin revenue streams have dragged margins way down since then. Today, Tencent has 47% gross margins and 30% operating margins, and both of those metrics are rapidly dropping.But, margin compression wasn’t a big problem for Tencent from 2015 to 2017 because revenue growth was big enough to offset margin compression. That is no longer the case. Last quarter, revenue growth decelerated meaningfully. That deceleration negatively impacted the company’s bottom line, as its operating profits actually dropped year-over-year.Therefore, unless Tencent’s revenue growth re-accelerates or its margin declines moderate, the outlook for Tencent’s profit growth isn’t all the great. At this point, with the Chinese economy slowing, no positive progress on U.S.-China trade talks, and Tencent’s top- and bottom-line issues, there is little reason to believe TCEHY stock will reach a positive turning point anytime soon.Long term, though, the upside is compelling. This is a company with robust exposure to all things internet in China. Tencent operates China’s largest social media platforms — Weixin and WeChat — and they have more than 1 billion combined active users. The company’s other social media and communication apps — QQ and Qzone — aren’t small either. They both have 500 million-plus monthly active users. Beyond social, Tencent is also the gaming giant in China, and it’s the top online games maker by revenue in the world. TCEHY also owns China’s biggest digital video, news, music, and literature platforms. As if that weren’t enough, Tencent also operates China’s largest mobile payment platform and its largest mobile security network.In other words, TCEHY not only has exposure to all things internet in China, it actually dominates all things internet in China. Thus, as goes the outlook for the growth of internet services in China, so goes Tencent. Considering that demand for internet services is expected to continue growing rapidly in China, Tencent stock is still supported by a favorable multiyear growth outlook.As a result, in the big picture, the near-term weakness of TCEHY stock price is a long-term buying opportunity. But, investors will want to wait for revenue growth turn the corner and/or margin declines to moderate before buying the dip.Source: ShutterstockThe riskiest yet potentially most rewarding stock on this list is Huya (NASDAQ:HUYA).Huya is China’s leading video streaming platform, and that inherently implies huge speculative long-term growth potential for this stock. Across the globe, live streaming video game viewership numbers are skyrocketing, and everyone from Amazon to Google to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is investing big into this market.But the biggest growth is happening China, where Huya reigns supreme. China is the world’s largest games market in terms of revenue and gamers. In 2017, gaming revenues were $32.2 billion in China, versus $26.4 billion the U.S. The disparity is mostly driven by the fact that China has 646 million gamers, essentially double the entire U.S. population.And this disparity is expected to only widen. Over the next five years, an expansion in China’s gamer base from 646 million to 917 million is expected to drive 13% compounded annual growth in gaming revenues. Meanwhile, in the U.S., gaming revenues are expected to grow at a mere 5% clip over the next five years.Clearly, China is the big growth story here. And when it comes to China video game live streaming, Huya is king with almost 50% market share (83 million monthly active users last year versus China gaming monthly users of 180 million).Consequently, as the China eSports and live streaming markets explode higher over the next several years, Huya stock should climb higher, too. But, this bull thesis isn’t without risk. Recent weak quarterly numbers imply market share erosion and slowing growth. If these trends persist, Huya stock will be stuck in its current downtrend.As such, the long-term growth narrative on Huya stock is promising. But, there are near term risks which should investors on the sidelines for the near term.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA, AMZN, WB, BIDU, GOOG, and FB.Compare BrokersThe post 8 China Stocks With Long-Term Upside appeared first on InvestorPlace."
MSFT,12-03-2018 09:14AM,Microsoft announces live captioning and subtitles for deaf,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-announces-live-captioning-subtitles-hearing-impaired-173046869.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Microsoft (MSFT) on Monday announced that it’s bringing live captioning and subtitles to two of its biggest products, PowerPoint and Skype. Set to coincide with the United Nations’ International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the move will facilitate communications between users with hearing difficulties or who speak different languages.I was able to experience the new communication features during a recent visit to Microsoft’s massive Redmond, Washington, campus. It worked incredibly well, offering seamless, real-time captioning that kept up with every word spoken in the room.That became a problem when it was translating Spanish to English and I began speaking in English, but that’s to be expected.Of course, Microsoft isn’t the only company working on or offering accessibility features for its consumers.Apple’s (AAPL) iOS lets individual users configure playback and captioning, and can read content out loud for those who have vision issues. There’s also a guided control feature that lets parents or caregivers ensure individuals with autism or attention and sensory issues stay on task by disabling the Home button, as well as portions of the display to limit accidental inputs.Microsoft’s accessibility team is run by Jenny Lay-Flurrie, the company’s chief accessibility officer and someone who understands how important such features are for users. As someone who’s been nearly deaf her whole life, Lay-Flurrie also stands to benefit from the captioning features coming to PowerPoint and Skype.According to the World Health Organization, roughly 1 billion people in the world have some form of disability. And unfortunately, using a computer or smartphone isn’t exactly easy for many of them.By adding real-time captioning, Microsoft will be able to open up PowerPoint and Skype to individuals with hearing problems. So if you’re hard of hearing, you’ll still be able to keep up with your coworker’s presentation, or chat with your friends and family across the globe. Of course, sign language is always an option, but thousands of people with hearing problems can’t sign. And if you also have a physical disability, signing might not even be an option.Outside of individuals with hearing problems, the captioning feature will also benefit folks without hearing problems who are working with others who speak different languages thanks to real-time translations.During my demonstration, the real-time translation provided English captions when a Microsoft representative was speaking Spanish and vice versa.But there are millions of other device users in the world who have disabilities unrelated to their hearing abilities. That’s why, Lay-Flurrie says, the company is continuing to work on additional capabilities that will allow the greatest number of people to use their devices without a problem.According to Lay-Flurrie, Microsoft considers accessibility features whenever it builds out a new product. Right now that includes technologies like high-contrast settings and magnifiers for people with vision problems, as well as the company’s recent Xbox Accessibility Controller, not to mention its work on ALS accessibility and mobility technologies.Microsoft says that it will continue to build out its new captioning and translation features for PowerPoint will support 12 spoken languages and more than 60 captionable languages at launch. Skype meanwhile will eventually support translation for 20 languages.The updates to the services roll out for PowerPoint in early 2019, while the translation feature for Skype is available Monday, Dec. 3.More from Dan:Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@oath.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

The company notes that in cases where audience members are hard of hearing or speak a different language than the presenter, the speaker's presentation may not be fully communicated, but a new tool aims to solve that problem. Soon, PowerPoint will be able to transcribe and caption what a speaker is saying in real-time, giving audience members the option of reading what a presenter is saying. And the tool will also be able to translate speech into different languages, subtitling the presentation into a language of the speaker's choice.At launch, the AI-powered tool will support 12 spoken languages and will be able to display captions or subtitles in over 60 languages. Microsoft also says that speech recognition technology will allow the tool to adapt to what's being presented in PowerPoint in order to provide more accurate recognition of names and terminology. Captions and subtitles will appear on screen and users will have the ability to adjust their size, position and appearance.Microsoft announced earlier this year that it wanted to use artificial intelligence for social good and it launched an AI for Accessibility program to fulfill that goal. It also showed off some of the accessibility features it was working on for Windows 10.Live captions and subtitles will start to roll out in January 2019. They'll be available for Office 365 subscribers using PowerPoint for Windows 10, PowerPoint for Mac and PowerPoint Online.'Overture' includes a new map, new modes and an 'emotional' mission.It's an unfortunate streak.StorySign turns words on the page into sign language.Google phone owners should have fewer memory management problems.Just 1,500 people still use the devices."
MSFT,12-03-2018 04:14PM,Here's What to Expect from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-expect-hewlett-packard-enterprise-001312346.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE saw its stock price jump 3.3% during regular trading hours Monday as part of a larger tech and market resurgence driven by the weekend’s positive trade war news. So, let’s see what to expect from Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s quarterly financial results Tuesday to help us understand if the company might be able to keep this momentum going.Overall, some of the biggest names in tech from Nvidia NVDA to Apple AAPL have seen their stock prices fall during the last few months. Yet, the tech sector as a whole has performed rather well during third-quarter earnings season, with total earnings up 27% from the same period last year on 13% higher revenues (also read: Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard).Last quarter, HPE saw its revenues jump 4% to $7.76 billion. However, the company, which was officially formed in 2015 after Hewlett-Packard split into HPE and HP Inc. HPQ, has failed to live up to investor expectations. The firm sells enterprise-level servers, storage, and networking gear, and has lost ground to the likes of Cisco CSCO and Dell DVMT. Plus, the cloud-computing age has seen Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT eat away at its business.OutlookWith all that said, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s quarterly earnings are projected to pop 2.5% to reach $7.85 billion, according to our Zacks Consensus Estimate. Better yet, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are excepted to soar 48.3% to reach $0.43 per share. Still, we need to know how likely it is that HPE tops our quarterly earnings estimate since this could determine how the company’s stock trades following its release.Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to help us. The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.HPE is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Unfortunately, this means that our model is inconclusive. But, investors should note that the company has topped our quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing four periods.Hewlett Packard Enterprise is set to release its fiscal fourth quarter financial results after the closing bell Tuesday.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

MSFT,12-03-2018 03:14PM,Microsoft (MSFT) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-msft-gains-lags-market-224510400.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.In the latest trading session, Microsoft (MSFT) closed at $112.09, marking a +1.08% move from the previous day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.09%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.13%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.51%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the software maker had gained 4.69% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.28% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.92% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from MSFT as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be January 30, 2019. On that day, MSFT is projected to report earnings of $1.09 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 13.54%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $32.46 billion, up 12.24% from the year-ago period.MSFT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.43 per share and revenue of $124.08 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +14.18% and +12.43%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for MSFT. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.38% higher. MSFT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Investors should also note MSFT's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 25.05. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 31.06, so we one might conclude that MSFT is trading at a discount comparatively.It is also worth noting that MSFT currently has a PEG ratio of 2.01. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Software was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.17 at yesterday's closing price.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 93, which puts it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

At market close on Friday Microsoft stole from Apple a coveted title: most valuable public company in the world.  On Monday Apple recaptured the No. 1 position, although the difference between the companies is less than $17 billion."
MSFT,12-03-2018 01:14PM,Amazon is now in the running in a three-way race to become the world's most valuable public company,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-now-running-three-way-210800197.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Amazon AMZN , Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT are in a tight race for the title of world's most valuable public company. The three have tossed around the title over the past few trading days, each closing with a market cap over $860 billion. Microsoft surpassed Apple in market cap on Friday, only for Apple to overtake it again on Monday. Amazon briefly eclipsed both companies during intraday trading Monday. As of Monday's close, Apple took the lead with a market cap of $877 billion. Amazon followed at $866 billion, then Microsoft with $860 billion.The horse race between these tech giants has intensified as the tech sector has seen an upswing from October declines and following the White House's announcement of a 90-day trade truce with China on Saturday. The stocks have been closely watched since August, when Apple became the first publicly traded company in the U.S. to reach $1 trillion in market cap. About a month later, Amazon reached the same milestone before markets closed, ending the day just below the $1 trillion mark.Microsoft's lead on Friday marked a significant shift in the tech sector, as the company hasn't closed a year in the top seat since 2002 and has not been the most valuable tech stock since 2010. While Apple and Amazon had been the two front-runners by market cap size, recent setbacks at the companies have given Microsoft a leg up. The company has seen its value more than triple since Satya Nadella took over as CEO from Steve Ballmer in February 2014, as Nadella has accelerated the company's transition into cloud-based services and allowed other parts of the business to take priority over the Windows PC operating system.Since Apple announced on its fourth-quarter 2018 earnings call that moving forward it would no longer disclose iPhone unit sales , investors have worried the company is getting ready for a significant drop-off in sales of its flagship product.Amazon saw a similar sell-off after delivering weak guidance in its third-quarter 2018 earnings report. The company expected $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter operating income, well below Street estimates of $3.9 billion for the quarter that spans the holiday season.Both companies have rebounded with the market and the pause in trade tensions with China. On Monday, Amazon closed up 4.9 percent and Apple was up 3.5 percent.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.More From CNBC"

NVDA,12-03-2018 05:14AM,NVIDIA's new AI turns videos of the real world into virtual landscapes,https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/03/nvidia-ai-video-to-video-synthesis/?yptr=yahoo,"Attendees of this year's NeurIPS AI conference in Montreal can spend a few moments driving through a virtual city, courtesy of NVIDIA. While that normally wouldn't be much to get worked up over, the simulation is fascinating because of what made it possible. With the help of some clever machine learning techniques and a handy supercomputer, NVIDIA has cooked up a way for AI to chew on existing videos and use the objects and scenery found  within them to build interactive environments.NVIDIA's research here isn't just a significant technical achievement; it also stands to make it easier for artists and developers to craft lifelike virtual worlds. Instead of having to meticulously design objects and people to fill a space polygon by polygon, they can use existing machine learning tools to roughly define those entities and let NVIDIA's neural network fill in the rest.""Neural networks — specifically generative models — will change how graphics are created,"" Bryan Catanzano, NVIDIA's vice president of applied deep learning, said in a statement. ""This will enable developers, particularly in gaming and automotive, to create scenes at a fraction of the traditional cost.""Here's how it works. Catanzano told reporters that researchers trained the fledgling neural model with dashcam videos taken from self-driving car trials in cities for about a week on one of the company's DGX-1 supercomputers. (NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang once called the DGX-1 the equivalent of ""250 servers in a box,"" so pulling off a similar feat at home seems all but impossible.)Meanwhile, the research team used Unreal Engine 4 to create what they called a ""semantic map"" of a scene, which essentially assigns every pixel on-screen a label. Some pixels got lumped into the ""car"" bucket, others into the ""trees"" category, or ""buildings"" — you get it. Those clumps of pixels were also given clearly defined edges, so Unreal Engine ultimately produced a sort of ""sketch"" of a scene that got fed to NVIDIA's neural model. From there, the AI applied the visuals for what it knew a ""car"" looked like to the clump of pixels labeled ""car"" and repeated the same process for every other classified object in the scene. That might sound tedious, but the whole thing happened faster than you might think -- Catanzaro said the car simulation ran at 25 frames-per-second and that the AI rendered everything in real time.NVIDIA's team also used this new video-to-video synthesis technique to digitally coax a team member into dancing like PSY. Crafting this model took the same kind of work as the car simulation, only this time the AI was tasked with figuring out the dancer's poses, turning them into rudimentary stick figures and rendering another person's appearance on top of them.For now, the company's results speak for themselves. They're not as graphically rich or as detailed as a typical scene rendered in a AAA video game, but NVIDIA's sample videos offer glimpses at digital cities filled with objects that do sort of look real. Emphasis on ""sort of."" The tongue-in-cheek Gangnam Style body swaps worked a little better.While NVIDIA has open-sourced all of its underlying code, it'll likely be a while yet before developers will start using these tools to flesh out their next VR set pieces. That's just as well, honestly, since the company was quick to point out the neural network's limitations: while the virtual cars zipping around its simulated cityscape looked surprisingly true-to-life, NVIDIA said its model wasn't great at rendering vehicles as they turn because its label maps lacked sufficient information. More troubling to VR artisans is the fact that certain objects, like those pesky cars, might not always look the same as the scene progresses; in particular, NVIDIA said those objects may change color slightly over time. These all are clearly representations of real-world objects, but they're a long way from being photo-realistic for long periods of time.Those technical shortcomings are one thing; it's sadly not hard to see how these techniques could be used for unsavory purposes, too. Just look at deepfakes: it's getting remarkably difficult to tell these artificially generated videos apart from the real thing, and as NVIDIA proved with its Gangnam Style test, its neural model could be used to create uncomfortable situations for real people. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Catanzaro largely looks on the bright side.""People really enjoy virtual experiences,"" he told Engadget. ""Most of the time they're used for good things. We're focused on the good applications."" Later, though, he conceded people using tools like these for things he doesn't approve of is the ""nature of technology"" and pointed out that ""Stalin was Photoshopping people out of pictures in the '50s before Photoshop even existed.""There's no denying that NVIDIA's research is a notable step forward in digital imaging, and in time it may help change the way we create and interact with virtual worlds. For commerce, for art, for innovation and more, that's a good thing. Even so, the existence of these tools also means the line between real events and fabricated ones will continue to grow more tenuous, and pretty soon we'll have to start really reckoning with what these tools are capable of.'Overture' includes a new map, new modes and an 'emotional' mission.It's an unfortunate streak.StorySign turns words on the page into sign language.Google phone owners should have fewer memory management problems.Just 1,500 people still use the devices."

Consensus analyst estimates appear to have more than priced in this issue: Not only is Nvidia expected to see its Gaming segment revenue (it covers sales of PC gaming GPUs and console processors) drop 17% annually during the January quarter, it's expected to see annual drops in each of the following three quarters before returning to growth.  Overall, Gaming revenue, which still accounts for slightly over half of Nvidia's total revenue, is expected be down 3% in fiscal 2020 (ends in Jan. 2020) to $6.38 billion, following a 19% increase in fiscal 2019."
NVDA,12-03-2018 04:14PM,Here's What to Expect from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-expect-hewlett-packard-enterprise-001312346.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE saw its stock price jump 3.3% during regular trading hours Monday as part of a larger tech and market resurgence driven by the weekend’s positive trade war news. So, let’s see what to expect from Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s quarterly financial results Tuesday to help us understand if the company might be able to keep this momentum going.Overall, some of the biggest names in tech from Nvidia NVDA to Apple AAPL have seen their stock prices fall during the last few months. Yet, the tech sector as a whole has performed rather well during third-quarter earnings season, with total earnings up 27% from the same period last year on 13% higher revenues (also read: Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard).Last quarter, HPE saw its revenues jump 4% to $7.76 billion. However, the company, which was officially formed in 2015 after Hewlett-Packard split into HPE and HP Inc. HPQ, has failed to live up to investor expectations. The firm sells enterprise-level servers, storage, and networking gear, and has lost ground to the likes of Cisco CSCO and Dell DVMT. Plus, the cloud-computing age has seen Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT eat away at its business.OutlookWith all that said, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s quarterly earnings are projected to pop 2.5% to reach $7.85 billion, according to our Zacks Consensus Estimate. Better yet, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are excepted to soar 48.3% to reach $0.43 per share. Still, we need to know how likely it is that HPE tops our quarterly earnings estimate since this could determine how the company’s stock trades following its release.Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to help us. The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.HPE is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Unfortunately, this means that our model is inconclusive. But, investors should note that the company has topped our quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing four periods.Hewlett Packard Enterprise is set to release its fiscal fourth quarter financial results after the closing bell Tuesday.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Indeed, the bulk of my career has been turning relatively boring numbers into a meaningful, riveting narrative.I’ve got to be honest though. Sometimes in the interest of making art, the world’s financial media machine inadvertently unleashes a dangerous beast.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLargely left for dead as of early 2016, AMD’s regrouping effort caught a lot of investors, as well as rivals like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), by surprise. The financial news business loves redemption stories almost as much as it loves a good fall from grace, and we had no problem adding a sizzle to the steak.That’s fine. It’s just the nature of the business. In our effort to spin a good yarn, however, I can’t help but wonder if we’ve left AMD far too subject to the next headline, and far too unreflective of just how much money this company is likely to earn in the foreseeable future.And now we’re having a tough time putting the genie back in the bottle.Don’t misread the message. It’s not that market commentators and stock-pickers aren’t allowed to have and voice an opinion on Advanced Micro Devices. By and large though, the industry’s professionals have been just as enamored by AMD, or just a critical of it, as the amateurs have been.Perhaps worse, AMD stock has been good about responding to the daily headlines. It’s a headache simply because the rhetoric seems to change on a pretty regular basis.Don’t take my word for it. Just check out this sampling of unusually-opinionated commentary just from the past couple of weeks.What the [insert explicative of your choice here]? You could get dizzy/whiplash if you’re watching the headlines a little too closely.And the stock mostly has moved in step with each shift in the prevailing opinion, though simultaneously, it’s made even bigger moves in step with the shifts in the bigger-picture themes the financial media has latched onto.AMD soared more than 40% between August and September on the assumption that its new-and-improved portfolio would finally yield considerable profits. Shares have given all of that gain back with an alarmingly brisk pullback in the meantime though, as investors faced the reality minting money just yet.Investors, in short, have been taken on a wild ride that wouldn’t have been quite so wild if all of us had kept a little perspective. We let the hype shape our assumptions, rather than reality. Trained to trade it though, too many of us are more worried about the next headline than figuring out next year’s plausible bottom line growth.The frustrating irony is, Advanced Micro Devices truly has rekindled its former greatness. It’s going to beat Intel to the 7 nanometer finish line by a country mile, and though Nvidia is still the king of the GPU market, AMD is positioned to make a measurable dent in its dominance come 2019. Credit has to be given where it’s due.None of that really matters right now though. Right the only thing that matters is making the right call on which way the next swing is pointed. Fundamentals (yep, they still matter, even here in late-2018) have yet to become part of the equation again.It’s not a condition that will last forever; eventually traders will tire of playing the game. In the meantime though, ignoring the fact that AMD stock has been hijacked by fear and greed could prove destructive to your portfolio’s value.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

NVDA,12-03-2018 10:14AM,All You Need To Know About NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Financial Health,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-nvidia-corporation-nasdaq-nvda-174620925.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.With a market capitalization of US$100b, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a large-cap stock, which is considered by most investors as a safe bet. Common characteristics for these big stocks are their strong balance sheet and high liquidity, which means there’s plenty of stocks available to the public for trading. These companies are resilient in times of low liquidity and are not as strongly impacted by interest rate hikes as companies with lots of debt. Assessing the most recent data for NVDA, I will take you through the key ratios to measure financial health, in particular, its solvency and liquidity.See our latest analysis for NVIDIANVDA’s debt level has been constant at around US$2.0b over the previous year which accounts for long term debt. At this constant level of debt, NVDA currently has US$7.6b remaining in cash and short-term investments for investing into the business. On top of this, NVDA has produced cash from operations of US$4.2b during the same period of time, resulting in an operating cash to total debt ratio of 211%, meaning that NVDA’s debt is appropriately covered by operating cash. This ratio can also be interpreted as a measure of efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In NVDA’s case, it is able to generate 2.11x cash from its debt capital.At the current liabilities level of US$1.6b, it appears that the company has maintained a safe level of current assets to meet its obligations, with the current ratio last standing at 7.08x. Having said that, a ratio greater than 3x may be considered by some to be quite high, however this is not necessarily a negative for the company.With debt at 21% of equity, NVDA may be thought of as appropriately levered. NVDA is not taking on too much debt commitment, which may be constraining for future growth.NVDA’s high cash coverage and appropriate debt levels indicate its ability to utilise its borrowings efficiently in order to generate ample cash flow. In addition to this, the company exhibits proper management of current assets and upcoming liabilities. I admit this is a fairly basic analysis for NVDA’s financial health. Other important fundamentals need to be considered alongside. You should continue to research NVIDIA to get a more holistic view of the stock by looking at:To help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

NVDA,12-02-2018 06:14PM,NVIDIA's Next Titan Might Be Imminent,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-apos-next-titan-might-203000834.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Back in August, graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) unveiled its latest Turing graphics architecture, as well as a range of graphics processing units (GPUs) based on that architecture, targeted at both the high-end gaming market and the professional visualization segment.As far as high-end gaming goes, the top Turing-based product NVIDIA introduced was the RTX 2080 Ti. It's based on a chip that NVIDIA refers to as TU102, the company's most powerful Turing-based chip.Image source: NVIDIA.The RTX 2080 Ti, notably, isn't based on a fully enabled version of its TU102 chip. The company has some portions of the chip disabled, probably to improve manufacturing yields. Last month, I wrote about how NVIDIA could release a gaming-oriented halo product, sold under its Titan branding, based on a fully enabled version of the TU102 chip.WCCFTech reported on a YouTuber who tweeted an image of the inside of his computer, showing what appears to be an unreleased NVIDIA Titan graphics card. If this image is real, it could suggest the imminent launch of a higher-end, and higher-priced, Titan card based on a fully enabled TU102.Here's why it'd make sense for NVIDIA to get such a card out as soon as possible.NVIDIA shares recently plummeted because the company's most recently issued financial outlook came in well below expectations. Driving that weak outlook was that there's simply too much inventory of the company's mid-range Pascal-based products sitting in the channel as demand for GPUs for cryptocurrency mining has abated. CFO Colette Kress said the ""Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipment in the mid-range Pascal segment to allow channel inventory to normalize.""By introducing a new ultra high-end gaming GPU under its Titan branding, NVIDIA can drum up some excitement and positive press for its gaming products as a whole and can probably generate some incremental, high-margin revenue from sales of expensive graphics cards to gamers and PC enthusiasts with deep pockets.And frankly, as long as NVIDIA can produce more than enough fully enabled TU102 chips to meet the demand for them from its professional visualization customers, why shouldn't the company start selling cards based on those chips to gamers, too?Releasing a new ultra-high-end Titan graphics card isn't the sort of move that's going to compensate for what's happening in the midrange of NVIDIA's desktop GPU business, which Kress said "" is typically about one-third of our gaming business.""Nevertheless, getting such a product out there would probably be trivially easy for NVIDIA to do at this point. The design is already done, fully enabled TU102 chips are already being sold -- under the Quadro brand to professional visualization customers -- and the company's Titan-based graphics cards tend to be products NVIDIA designs and sells directly through its website, so distributing these cards shouldn't be terribly difficult, either.In short, I think the image the YouTuber posted of an upcoming NVIDIA Titan card is legitimate, and I wouldn't be surprised to see such a card hit the market quite soon.More From The Motley FoolMore From The Motley FoolAshraf Eassa has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

NVDA,11-30-2018 06:14PM,3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-earnings-reports-watch-next-142203266.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Editor’s note: InvestorPlace’s Earnings to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings calendar picks.The market seems a bit quieter at the moment, and that’s probably a good thing. A noisy October sent U.S. stocks stumbling, despite strong earnings reports from a number of companies. As the earnings calendar faded, the market re-tested the lows ahead of Thanksgiving, but it’s bounced back nicely over the past few sessions.That rally has kept the broad market at least positive for 2018. But it’s worth noting that so far this year investors have treated different sectors in very different ways. Cyclical stocks, in particular, have seen multiple waves of selling. More stable – and more consumer-facing – issues actually have held up surprisingly well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat divergence sets up an interesting group of earnings reports next week. It includes releases in three sectors that have moved in opposite directions in 2018. One group of retailers actually trade near not only year-to-date highs, but all-time highs — and one of its leaders will try and keep that strength intact.On the other hand, a leading chipmaker will try and stem the bleeding in that struggling sector. And numbers from a smaller homebuilder could have a large effect on a significant swath of the market. Earnings season is over, but the earnings calendar next week still bears watching.Source: ShutterstockEarnings Report Date: Tuesday, Dec. 4, before market openIt’s been quite a reversal for auto parts retailers like AutoZone (NYSE:AZO). 18 months ago, AZO, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP), and O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY), were skidding. Investors were convinced that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) would enter the space – and bring pricing, and margins, for the existing entrants.No longer. All three stocks trade near all-time highs. AZO has risen almost 40% since fiscal Q3 earnings in May. And the gains set up a big fiscal Q1 report on Tuesday morning — for AZO stock and for peers.Valuation certainly isn’t prohibitive: AZO trades at 14.3x FY19 consensus EPS estimates. And analysts are only expecting about 1.8% revenue growth year-over-year in Q1, albeit with 20%-plus EPS growth aided by tax reform and share buybacks. At least from a top-line standpoint, the bar for AZO’s Q1 doesn’t seem particularly high.But it’s a bar at this point that AutoZone needs to reach. The gains of late have pushed AZO above the average analyst price target. To get the Street back on board — and get analysts raising estimates and fair value calculations — AutoZone likely needs a strong quarter. Any weakness could raise pricing fears — or at least suggest that maybe the three stocks have run too far.ORLY and AAP shareholders will be watching closely — because the stocks tend to trade as a group. If AutoZone can keep the positive news flowing, earnings multiples for all three stocks could continue to expand — and upside should continue. If not, AZO’s Q1 earnings could be the first step in another reversal of sentiment toward the sector.Source: ShutterstockEarnings Report Date: Tuesday, Dec. 5, after market close (earnings call on Wednesday morning)Housing stocks, including those of homebuilders like Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), have been hammered this year. Concerns about slowing demand have combined with rising costs driven in part by tariffs applied to imports from both Canada and China. TOL stock has dropped 30% so far this year — and many peers have done even worse.The space needs a good report – particularly given Toll Brothers’ focus on the high end of the market. The question is if even that will be enough. Toll Brothers actually has had a very strong year from an earnings standpoint. Investors’ forward-looking fears, however, have more than offset the strength shown in backward-looking reports.If TOL can post another strong quarter, and investors buy the stock, that could be a sign that homebuilders – and maybe building products suppliers and distributors as well — are ready to bottom. If Toll misses though, and high-end demand worries are added to the existing problems, the rout in the sector could get even worse.Source: ShutterstockEarnings Report Date: Thursday, Dec. 6, after market closeThe semiconductor sector is another industry that could use some good news – but Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) actually has dodged the recent pressure on chip stocks. AVGO took a hit in October with peers — but it’s bounced about 13% in a little over a month.Broadcom is unlikely to see a major move along the lines of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) — the options market is pricing in about a 6% move next week. But the fiscal Q4 report does seem rather important.The company still needs to support its acquisition of CA, a move into software that took investors by surprise. Any weakness either in Q4 results or Q1 guidance could spook a market already nervous about cyclicality in the chip space.I personally liked AVGO stock back in April, and at similar levels, I still think it’s a buy. But Thursday’s report is important enough that it could change – or cement – that bullishness.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.Compare BrokersThe post 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week appeared first on InvestorPlace."
NVDA,11-30-2018 06:14PM,Drop in Semiconductor Stocks a Bad Omen for the Market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drop-semiconductor-stocks-bad-omen-214713506.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.- By John KinsellaghGiven the recent concern about the uncertainty in predicting the yield curve and, with it, the likely direction of the market, investors would be better informed by looking at one measure that, since 2016, has had a high probability of predicting the direction of the overall market.Trade tensions with China have caused shares in the semiconductor industry to drop precipitously over the past two months. There is a strong correlation between the direction of semiconductor stocks and the direction of the broader market. Chip shares often precede the S&P 500's fall and rise. According to Dow Jones Market Data, The PHLX Semiconductor Index and the overall stock market have moved in tandem 78% of the time this year. The semiconductor group comprises 3.2% of the index. Since 2016, when semiconductor stocks started their rapid ascent, the correlation was 76%.Some individual stocks in the sector have fared better than others. Despite a steep drop of 3% since October, Advanced Micro Device's (AMD) stock still retains its status as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year, with a phenomenal gain of 108%. AMD shares have swung wildly this year, with a 52-week high of $34 and a low of $9.Shares of other microchip makers didn't fare as well. Micron Technology's (MU) stock tumbled 16% since the beginning of October, giving the shares a 7.8% decline for the year. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which was swept up in the tech rout, has fallen 44% since early October.Misery loves company, and other tech stocks have joined the semiconductor group suffering steep losses recently, based on indications of slowing revenue growth. Investors have fled the sector, pulling $2.2 billion from global tech funds for the month, according to EPFRE, a fund-flow data company. This exodus comes after investors added $52.3 billion to the sector during the August 2016 through August 2018 period.Investors are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the G20 summit for an update on the state of trade negotiations with China. Microchips are used in a variety of sectors that recently have been posting rapid growth, such as the fast-growing rise of data centers to facilitate the increasing move to cloud computing as well as gaming and artificial intelligence.Lessening global demand and the imposition of retaliatory measures by China will have a severe impact on the group. The drop in semiconductor shares could prove to be foreboding for the market. As chipmakers face uncertain demand, many investors have shifted out of the sector into software stocks that are involved in the increasingly lucrative business of cloud database services.Two companies, VMware (VMW) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW), have ridden the explosive growth in the cloud or cybersecurity businesses and have poster strong earnings. Another company that is attracting investors' attention is surging cloud computing giant Microsoft (MSFT).Some fund managers have viewed the steep declines as presenting a propitious buying opportunity. For some investors, one of the attractive buys was Nvidia. Nvidia currently has a forward price-earnings ratio of 22.8, a drop form 42.1 at the beginning of the year. By comparison, according to FactSet, the price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is currently 15.3, down from 18.1. Nvidia shares are currently $163, up from its 52-week low of $137 and down from its 52-week high of $292.Disclosure: I have no positions in any of the securities referenced in this article.Read more here:This article first appeared on GuruFocus."

WB,12-03-2018 12:14PM,7 Beaten-Down Chinese Stocks Ready to Rebound,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-beaten-down-chinese-stocks-203209607.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Over the past several months, investors have thrown Chinese stocks in the garbage pile, and they haven’t once second guessed it. This is particularly true for Chinese tech stocks. The Invesco China Technology ETF (NYSE:CQQQ) peaked in January. Since then, it has dropped more than 30%, indicative of what has been a broad and relentless selloff in Chinese stocks.But, this selloff could be coming to an end soon. After all, the long-term fundamentals underlying many of these big growth Chinese tech names still remain very strong. China’s consumer class continues to urbanize and digitize at a rapid rate, and the size of this class is unprecedented. Thus, the long-term implications of more widespread phone usage, e-shopping, digital advertising, traveling, so on and so forth, are quite large.But, the market has ignored those long-term growth fundamentals for almost all of 2018. Instead, the market has chosen to focus on a weak broader economic backdrop, which has been dragged down by escalating U.S. and China trade tensions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThose tensions are finally deescalating. Over the weekend, the two countries agreed to a 90-day trade truce that will allow for further discussions and negotiations. While this isn’t a resolution, it is a step toward resolution and a step toward Chinese stocks rebounding.With that in mind, here’s a list of seven Chinese stocks, which, once all this trade noise clears up, should rebound in a big way.Source: ShutterstockThe Fundamentals: China’s most well-known and biggest tech company, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is supported by big growth fundamentals that imply a healthy long-term growth trajectory for this company and stock. Last quarter, core commerce revenues grew by over 50% yet again, while cloud computing revenues rose 90%. Margins took a hit, but that compression is all tied to growth-related investments and will inevitably phase out over time. Thus, in the big picture, the fundamentals here remain strong, supported by the continued urbanization and digitization of China’s economy.The Valuation: Following the recent dip in BABA stock, this stock now trades at just 24X forward earnings. That is low both for this stock and relative to the company’s 50%-plus revenue growth rates.The Technicals: BABA stock seems to have bottomed in late November around $130. It has been on an uptrend ever since, and should remain on this uptrend so long as trade war concerns remain muted.Source: ShutterstockThe Fundamentals: Often considered the Twiter (NYSE:TWTR) of China, Chinese social communication app Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) is supported by healthy long-term growth fundamentals. The platform now has nearly 450 million users, making it one of the largest social media platforms in the world. Weibo is also adding users at a fairly consistent 70 million new users per year rate. Revenue growth is running in excess of 40%. Margins are stable. And, those numbers will only get better as China’s digital advertising landscape matures. Overall, there’s a lot to like here.The Valuation: Perhaps the best thing to like about WB stock is the valuation. This stock trades at just 20X forward earnings. That is an anemic valuation for a 40%-plus revenue growth company with a rapidly growing user base and stable margins.The Technicals: WB stock has been in a huge downtrend for the past several months. But, the stock has shown strong support in the mid-$50’s, and it is now rallying in a big way off that level. This rally should persist so long as U.S. and China trade relations improve.Source: ShutterstockThe Fundamentals: Chinese internet giant Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is supported by robust long-term growth fundamentals that are perhaps second to only Alibaba. From head to toe, Tencent is the Chinese internet. The company operates the country’s largest social media platforms (one of which is the only billion user platform in China). Tencent is also the gaming giant in China, and owns China’s biggest digital video, news, music and literature platforms. Tencent also operates China’s largest mobile payment platform and the country’s largest mobile security network. Thus, Tencent is the Chinese internet. So long as internet usage in China picks up (which it inevitably will), Tencent will grow at a healthy rate.The Valuation: The valuation on TCEHY stock is fairly attractive at just over 30X this year’s earnings estimate. But, margins have been a major headwind for this company, and until that headwind clears up, valuation will be capped.The Technicals: Despite a long-term downtrend, TCEHY stock has found solid support over the past few months in the lower $30’s. Now, the stock is bouncing strongly off those levels, and rallying to levels not seen since late September. This uptrend looks strong, and should last so long as broad China economic sentiment improves.Source: ShutterstockThe Fundamentals: Chinese internet search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is, for all intents and purposes, the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of China. This positioning guarantees Baidu healthy long-term growth potential so long as internet usage and digital advertising in China accelerate higher, two things, which seem certain at this point in time. Moreover, Baidu has high-growth potential through its cloud, IoT and AI businesses, the sum of which are still in the early stages of potentially explosive growth trajectories.The Valuation: BIDU stock is pretty cheap at under 20X forward earnings for what was 27% revenue growth last quarter. Falling margins are behind the low valuation. But, this is a near-term phenomena. Huge losses at iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) and big investments into the app ecosystem are dragging on margins. Eventually, those margin headwinds will fade out. Once they do, today’s valuation will seem anemic.The Technicals: Much like other Chinese stocks, BIDU has been on a big downtrend for the past several months. But, this stock has shown strong support multiple times around the $180 level. Today, the stock is comfortably above that level, implying that a bottom has been put in and that this stock is ready to start heading higher again.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrThe Fundamentals: Alibaba isn’t the only e-commerce player in the Chinese market. The other big player here is JD (NASDAQ:JD). Much like Alibaba, JD is a big-growth e-commerce company with secular growth tailwinds through the urbanization and digitization of China’s consumer economy. Revenue growth is cooling at JD because of slower economic growth (25% revenue growth last quarter versus 40% growth in the year-ago quarter). Margins are also dropping. But, despite near-term choppiness, the fundamentals of this company, through continued robust e-commerce growth in China, remain favorable.The Valuation: JD stock trades at just 0.5X trailing sales. That is a really low sales multiple. It strongly implies that both revenue growth will continue to slow and that margins will continue to compress. But, if China’s economy improves from here due to de-escalating trade war tensions, JD’s revenue growth will re-accelerate and margins will stabilize, thus making the current valuation seem too low.The Technicals: JD stock has been one of the biggest losers in the Chinese stock rout. But, the stock is bouncing nicely off of the critical $20 level amid improving macroeconomic conditions, a dynamic that implies that this stock may have found a bottom.Source: Thomas Galvez via FlickrThe Fundamentals: Perhaps the most underrated Chinese tech stock is China’s go-to online travel site, Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP). While Alibaba, JD and Baidu get all the market attention, Ctrip is a company that is supported by just as strong, if not stronger, underlying fundamentals. Often called the Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) of China, Ctrip has been a big winner over the past several years as China’s rising consumer class has finally embraced air travel. Although this China air travel growth narrative has hit a few road-bumps in 2018 due to slowing China economic growth, the long-term outlook for Ctrip remains favorable. Just 7% of Chinese citizens have a passport, versus 40% in America. Because of this discrepancy, the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute (COTRI) predicts that Chinese overseas trips will grow from 145 million last year, to over 400 million by 2030.The Valuation: CTRP stock is still expensive relative to its peers, trading at nearly 30 forward earnings. But, that valuation is warranted given the China air travel industry’s strong long-term fundamentals, and the lack of competition that Ctrip has in that burgeoning industry.The Technicals: From June to November, CTRP stock dropped from $50 to $25. But, after a big post-earnings collapse in early November, CTRP stock has rebounded strongly, implying that those early November lows may have been a bottom for the stock.Source: ShutterstockThe Fundamentals: Another underrated gem in the Chinese tech stock group is video streaming platform Huya (NASDAQ:HUYA). Much like Ctrip, this company doesn’t get much mainstream media attention. But, also like Ctrip, Huya is supported by exceptionally favorable long-term growth fundamentals. Across the globe, live streaming video game viewership numbers are skyrocketing higher as consumers look for alternative entertainment options. The biggest market for video game streaming? China, with $32.2 billion in gaming revenues in 2017. The fastest growing market? China, with a projected 13% compounded annual revenue growth rate over the next five years. The biggest player in the Chinese market? Huya, with nearly 50% market share. Consequently, Huya has huge long-term growth prospects through the mainstream proliferation of esports and live video game streaming in China.The Valuation: HUYA stock is expensive. The stock trades at over 6X trailing sales. But, Huya is in the category of streaming. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the leader in this category, and that stock trades at nearly 9X trailing sales. Thus, if Huya realizes its long-term potential as a major streaming player on the video game side, today’s valuation will ultimately prove to be exceptionally conservative.The Technicals: Unlike other Chinese stocks on this list, HUYA stock hasn’t found a bottom yet. This stock continues to drop and act like a falling knife. Thus, there isn’t really anything here for technical and/or momentum investors to hang their hat on, and that could prove to be a headwind for this stock in the near term.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA, TWTR, WB, BIDU, GOOG, CTRP and NFLX.Compare BrokersThe post 7 Beaten-Down Chinese Stocks Ready to Rebound appeared first on InvestorPlace."
WB,12-03-2018 10:15AM,Some Pre-Earnings Homework for Momo Stock Followers,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pre-earnings-homework-momo-stock-183433992.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.Growth isn’t the issue for China’s Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO); it has been able to do that in spades. Rather, the yardstick by which Momo stock has been and still is judged is the pace of its growth. Anything less than red-hot forward progress has been viewed as a letdown, despite topping earnings estimates in each of its past eleven quarters.It would also be naive to pretend it hasn’t been lumped in with the likes of Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and other Chinese tech stocks. The escalating trade war and subsequent economic slowdown for the world’s second-biggest economy had spooked investors.With the tariff showdown currently taking a cease-fire and likely to be closer to its end than not though, in addition to a garden-variety oversold condition, Thursday’s earnings report may well light a fire under Momo stock again. The chart’s certainly set up for such a move.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe key will be what kind of mood investors are in at the time… will they be optimistic, or pessimistic?Originally scheduled for Wednesday morning, China’s online dating platform Momo rescheduled the report on Monday in light of the fact that U.S. markets will be closed on Dec. 5 to honor the passing of former President George HW Bush. The report and corresponding conference call are now both slated for Thursday morning, before the market opens.The delay won’t change the numbers, however, which on a relative basis should be impressive enough.As of the latest look, analysts are calling for third-quarter earnings of 54 cents per share on sales of $533.6 million. Both will be up from the year-ago comparables of 45 cents per share of MOMO stock, and a top line of $354.5 million, extending a long streak of sizable organic and non-organic growth.The numbers, of course, are only part of the story.Though Momo has introduced its own tweaks to make its take on love connections more captivating, it has also bought some of its growth. Early this year it acquired Tantan, the so-called Tinder of China, making it more like its diversified western counterpart Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), which operates Match.com, Tinder, Our Time and other online dating sites. Integration with Tantan continues.Also, like any other social networking company, current and would-be owners of MOMO stock will be looking at the number of regular users the company’s sites boasts and how long they’re logged in. During the second quarter of this year, its platforms counted 108 million regular monthly users, and total paying users of its live video service reached 11.6 million a quarter earlier. Both figures will need to grow respectably for the third quarter to be considered a success. The amount of time spent per user using the app during the second quarter was up 11% year-over-year, and that number would also ideally increase.The one soft spot that could become a pitfall? Mobile games. Revenue fell 40% during the second quarter … the only arm to see a sales decline.And, the weighing all of those factors will be further impacted by politics.The tariff war had undoubtedly crimped China’s economy at a time when it couldn’t afford to be crimped. A combination of wage headwinds and slowing job growth — or at least fear of them — has proven problematic. The agreement between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping to call a truce to the tariff war can only help put Momo’s third quarter in a positive light, though the agreement between the two leaders is far from binding.While the character and quality of Momo’s earnings are key to the stock’s response to the news, just as telling right now is the technical read in Momo stock. It’s perfectly positioned to bounce, though if it doesn’t, it’s also perfectly positioned to suffer another wave of selling.Click to Enlarge Take a look. Momo has been brutalized since June’s peak, but the selling came to a halt when a familiar support line was met. This may be a subtle sign that there are more than a few bulls waiting in the wings to step back in. They just need the right catalyst.On the other hand, if the read on the numbers is a bearish one and Momo stock breaks below the floor extending back to the late-2016 low, there’s little that can be done to sidestep another round of selling.How things pan out for the stock will largely be a matter of perspective.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Weibo's third quarter 2018 earnings call. (foreign language) On today's call, I will share with you highlights of the Weibo user growth, product and the monetization as well as our key initiatives in 2018.(foreign language) First, let me discuss our third quarter financial results. We continue to see healthy revenue and user growth in this quarter. Our total revenue reached $460.2 million, up 44% year-over-year. Advertising and marketing revenue reached $409.3 million, up 48% year-over-year, with 83% of our ad revenue in Q3 from mobile. Non-GAAP operating margin during the third quarter reached 41%.(foreign language) On the user front, Weibo's monthly active users reached 445.9 million in September, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Additionally, the average daily active users in September reached 195.2 million, up 19% year-over-year, with 93% of Weibo's MAU from mobile.(foreign language) Thanks to our continuous efforts to enhance the operation and distribution of the trends, which are typically either hot issues or popular events discussed by users on Weibo, Weibo has further solidified its leading position as a platform for users to create and consume content. This strategy has allowed Weibo's user growth to continue to expand during the third quarter. Our focus to strengthen our platform ecosystem for social interactions among users and content distribution has further increased Weibo's value proposition as a social media platform and strengthened our platform's effect. In return, more and more advertisers are recognizing Weibo's ability in the social marketing.(foreign language) In discussing our operational updates for the third quarter, I will cover Weibo's progress in the area of users, content and the customers.(foreign language) First, on the user growth, we see that the organic growth of the mobile Internet user is slowing down and that short video industry is becoming increasingly competitive. These sectors have put some pressure on the growth rate of user's growth and the user engagement in the first half of 2018. In order to face these challenges, we have refined our strategy to be more focused on taking advantage of Weibo's core capabilities in social and the media areas to acquire users and to promote user engagement.(foreign language) For example, we will have to remain as an important platform for the discovery and distribution of the trends. These have been Weibo's main differentiators to acquire new users and to promote user engagement, and we continue to improve these capabilities. This quarter, we have adjusted our product operation strategy and the recommendation algorithm to strengthen our competitive edge.First, we have upgraded our topic products to highlight trends with hashtags acting as a point of aggregation, allowing users to discover and consume trends in multiple entry points such as our Weibo Hot Search and the topic feeds within the discovery zone.Second, we enhanced the distribution of trends on other platforms such as Weibo's WeChat mini program. These updates have encouraged more users to discover, consume, distribute and participate in the discussion of trends, which in return has allowed us to effectively acquire more users and promote user engagement. Notably, in Q3, the number of trends increased by triple digits sequentially and top content creators posts around trends increased by double digits on quarter-over-quarter basis.For example, in the third quarter, super typhoon Mangkhut, the strongest storm of 2018 and the most intense typhoon to affect the region since record keeping began, hit Guangdong province. We immediately engaged more than 100 local government agency accounts and our city ambassadors to broadcast the disaster relief efforts and to report the devastating effects of the typhoon and other related coverage in real time. More than 200,000 top content creators participated in the discussion in our platforms, helping more people be aware of the natural disaster and support recovery efforts. Over a 7-day period, the number of impressions on the topic #Typhoon Mangkhut# reached 7.3 billion, which resulted in an increase of millions of daily active users.(foreign language) Moving to the feed product. Our focus have always been on enhancing social content production and maintaining the user's social relation at the top priority for content distribution. Our goal is to amplify the platform's social features and to distinguish ourselves from the market. During the past 2 years, the competitive landscape of information feeds and videos have increased in the mobile Internet industry. Both have been the key drivers for user growth and our main focus around product development.(foreign language) Our 2 years of product development and enhancement have been paying off. Weibo's relationship with feeds and interest-based feeds' user growth and user consumption have grown rapidly and have gained popularity among users to consume content. This quarter, user engagement rate of relationship-based feeds as well as user consumption of interest-based feeds both achieved a healthy growth on a sequential basis.(foreign language) Meanwhile, with video, whether it is PGC or UGC format has become an important and a growing area within our content ecosystem. And we have achieved meaningful progress with our video products. In September, daily short video views and the posts grew by double digits from last year. Weibo stories' monthly active users and daily stories viewership both achieved healthy growth on a sequential base.(foreign language) The short video market has become increasingly competitive. In order to best position Weibo for success and sustain our long-term competitiveness, we are increasing investment in our user products to feature Weibo's unique advantages in content creation, consumption and user social interaction, so we can improve user acquisition efficiency.(foreign language) This quarter, we build out a new version of the Weibo app beyond initial test pool of users. Compared to the old version, we made 2 primary modifications. First, we have created a video tab named Weibo Video Community, allowing users to access video content at a primary entry point and featuring premium video content with IP and programs in series such as our daily vlog, makeup tutorials or set of videos with recurring characters or themes. We intend to cultivate habits for users to discover premium videos more efficiently and connect and interact with those creators they love.The viral distribution of short video is showing great promise in the increase of user viewership and advertising inventory. By leveraging our core capabilities in content distribution and fan's social connectivity. We think the video community will further help driving the growth of our video user scale and user time spent as it will be a designated center stage to a wide range of premium videos, and a platform for users to connect and interact with each other and with content creators.(foreign language) Further on the user product, we have optimized our discovery zone to further strengthen our competitive edge in the discovery and the discussion of the trends. We have structured Topic feeds and provided users personalized recommendation on topics they might be interested in, helping to promote user discussion among topics.We have integrated Topic products seamlessly into Weibo's Hot Search. On the one hand, any content on the Hot Search that have been formed as a topic will be assigned with a separate topic page. Users not only could discover what are hot and new controversial content on the Hot Search, but they will be also able to view other relevant information including discussions, video, articles and others within that topic page. On the other hand, as more users discover, consume, share, distribute and participate in the discussion of a particular issue or event, the hot issue or popular event could become the hottest topic on the Hot Search and eventually go viral on Weibo. This integration represents an information reinforcing cycle that effectively extends user content consumption for a longer period.(foreign language) We believe this upgrade is vital to further strengthen Weibo's uniqueness in the social media market, especially in the creation and consumption of video content and the distribution of trends. It's also a key driver to accelerate Weibo's future growth. The new version will be available to all users in the coming quarters based on the product optimization progress and the user's feedback.(foreign language) Moving to live broadcasting. Our strategic investment in Yi live broadcasting has solidified our leading edge in the live broadcasting market for media and celebrity verticals. Given the current competitive landscape of live broadcasting, we plan to acquire Yi's live broadcasting business in Q4. Our goal is to provide Weibo users with an improved live broadcasting experience by enabling better product integration between Weibo and Yi that focus in media, celebrity and showcase verticals. Ultimately, this acquisition is intended to increase traffic and revenue to Weibo's platform. Once acquisition process is completed, it will take us 1 or 2 quarters to fully integrate and optimize product. We believe the combination of Yi's live broadcasting business with Weibo will further enrich our content ecosystem, offer better support to top content creators and improve our monetization capability and efficiency.(foreign language) Moving on to content. In the third quarter, we expanded strategic cooperation with over 2,200 MCNs. Top content creators' posts as well as post views maintained double-digit growth from last year, representing higher engagement of the top content creators on Weibo. Weibo has become the inevitable platform for top content creators, primarily because of the following 2 reasons:(foreign language) First, as I mentioned last quarter, more and more KOLs have recognized Weibo's uniqueness from other content offering platforms. During this year, short video platforms became more popular among users. Many content creators returned into Weibo after establishing a baseline of influence and becoming top content creators on other platforms. Weibo is recognized as the ultimate platform for KOLs to expand their audience reach and to further gain public influence, whereby generating better monetization. In Q3, the number of top content creators from other platforms that returned to Weibo increased to nearly 3x sequentially. Those returned top content creators have been actively creating content.(foreign language) Second, we value the top content creators' experience and the growth on Weibo. We have largely increased the traffic support and subsidies to help top content creators monetize their content. For example, in Q3, we have provided more than RMB 500 million worth of advertising inventory at the subsidy to support top content creators to grow. At the same time, Weibo has allowed more top content creators to more effectively monetize their social assets after they have joined the Weibo Advertising Alliance program. As a result, the average number of posts generated by those content creators who entitled with our revenue sharing increased double digit. The considerable subsidies we're providing might temporarily restrain the demand of our native ads on the platform, thus affecting our short-term financial performance. However, based on our proven track record of successful cases, we believe it's more important to help top content creators grow on Weibo and accumulate social assets and be able to monetize on our platform over the longer run. We believe our strategy will facilitate top content creators greater incentive to create higher quality content, enhance user acquisition and the user engagement and to further broaden Weibo's content ecosystem. All of this will in return help our long-term sustainable growth of our future monetization.(foreign language) Lastly, turning to monetization. We achieved healthy ad revenue growth in the third quarter. This quarter, KA revenue increased 73% year-over-year. More and more advertisers do not just test their marketing campaigns on Weibo. They have increasingly realized Weibo's unique value of social marketing and the power of elaborating our content distribution, fans and KOLs influence. In short, they have considered Weibo as a strategic partner. This achievement could not be made without Weibo's continuous investment in the innovation and optimization of our monetization products. Our focus to strengthen the strategic cooperation with third party helped KA customer better recognize Weibo's marketing value and enable them to have a better marketing experience.Separately, the ""Weibo Uni Marketing program"", our collaboration with Alibaba launched in Q2, has made impressive progress this quarter. Currently, more than hundreds of brand advertisers have joined the program and are benefiting from its broad reach. For example, after joining the ""Weibo Uni Marketing"" program, Dyson was able to more precisely identify the target potential customers by leveraging the existing customer base on Weibo and Ali. After the marketing campaign, user's favorability of Dyson's vacuum product increased 43%. Moreover, data confirms that the more user interactions with Dyson ads on Weibo, the higher possibility the user will make a purchase through Dyson's Tmall store.(foreign language) Turning to SME. In the third quarter, SME revenues were up 35% year-over-year. However, our SME ad business confronted challenges in the following 2 aspects:(foreign language) First, macroeconomic headwinds are expected to continue in the near future, which have already led to a decrease in merchants' advertising spending in few vertical industries, such as auto services, wedding business and other consumer sectors with large ticket size and with a focus on targeting users in the first and second tier cities.(foreign language) Second, the gaming industry has been one of our top sale sectors of SME ad business. However, the regulatory changes in the gaming industry had a significant impact on marketing demand of gaming companies. We expect the regulatory impact and the length of the supervision lasting longer than we expected.(foreign language) In response to these challenges, we have made strategic adjustments by focusing on the following 3 aspects.(foreign language) First, we have adjusted the structure and focus of our sales teams who will actively seek for more opportunities to expand the customer base, including regional brand customers, and deploy tailored products and marketing solution to advertisers across more verticals. Notably, we made a meaningful progress in the online education sector in this quarter. Revenue contributed by this sector increased by triple digits year-over-year.(foreign language) Additionally, we intend to further subsidize MCNs and top content creators to grow and monetize on Weibo under the current macroeconomic condition. As they are one of our unique assets helped Weibo differentiate from other platforms. Our past supports and investments have enabled large amounts of MCNs and top content creators to grow rapidly on Weibo in the past few years. The considerable subsidies we provided might temporarily restrain the demand of our native ads on the platform, thus affecting our short-term financial performance. However, we believe our investments will benefit Weibo's overall ecosystem in the long run.(foreign language) Plus, although we expect the gaming sector's revenue contribution will decline in the short term, we insisted on increasing the investment to strengthen the operation of our gaming vertical on Weibo. On the one hand, we believe the resources we invested in the gaming vertical will enable us to acquire younger users at a lower cost while the gaming industry is currently in the adjustment cycle. In the longer term, we expect it will bring us corresponding returns after the industry returns back to normal. Notably, in this summer, we acquired many users in the gaming vertical through a series of activity and events.(foreign language) Overall, we have encountered challenges to grow our SME's ad business in the second half of the year, including the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on selected industry segments and the short- and medium-term impact of regulatory and economic policy changes on gaming. However, we will continue to invest in expanding customer base from resilient industries, supporting the MCNs and top content creators to build a better monetization ecosystem, developing more verticals that users will be interested in. All of this will in return help us to promote the growth of Weibo's SME assets in the longer term.(foreign language) With that, let me turn the call over to Fei Cao for our financial update.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fei Cao, Weibo Corporation - CFO & VP of Finance [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Gaofei. Welcome to Weibo's third quarter 2018 earnings call. As a reminder, we adopted ASC Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, and our new revenue guidance is consistent with this standard. In order to provide investors with clear comparisons, during today's call, I will also refer to our revenue and expense figures under the old revenue guidance, which excludes other transactions and includes value-added tax to the reported figures in our earning release.Now let me walk you through our financial highlights. All comparisons are on a year-on-year basis, unless otherwise noted.Weibo's third quarter net revenue was $460.2 million, a 44% or 43% under the old accounting standard or an increase of 48% on a constant currency basis. Strong advertising revenue growth was offset by the recent regulatory changes in certain verticals, particularly in the gaming industry, which led to a decrease in merchants' advertising spending during the quarter, especially for SMEs. We expect these regulatory adjustments will continue to affect the growth of these vertical's advertising spending in the near term. In addition, the continued depreciation of RMB related to U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter, and we expect foreign currency headwinds to continue in the near term.Non-GAAP operating income reached $188 million, up 42%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Weibo was 171.8 million, up 49%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.75 compared to $0.51 a year ago.Advertising and marketing revenue for the third quarter reached $409.3 million, up 48%, or an increase of 52% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue in the third quarter was $341.6 million, up 58%, representing 83% of our total ad revenue.Our focus to strengthen our platform ecosystems with user social interaction and content distribution has further increased Weibo's value proposition as a social media platform and strengthened the platform effect. Thereby, we continue to benefit from the shift in corporate ad spending toward mobile, social and video, with 93% of MAU for mobile in September. As a result, we are pleased to see that our total advertisers continue to grow from the last quarter.Turning to KA. In the third quarter, our KA ad revenue reached $186.2 million, up 73% or an increase of 78% on a constant currency basis. This strong key advertising revenue growth was driven by both an increase in ARPA and the expansion of Weibo's key advertiser base.Weibo is attracting key advertisers of all backgrounds with our focus on social relationships, combined with the competitive differentiators we have with our unique celebrity assets, KOLs, network effect, content diversity and the integrated marketing solutions. More notably, we continue to see noticeable growth in Weibo's top KA industries, with FMCG and IT, Electronics, Telecom -- namely 3C -- growing at triple digits year-over-year. In addition, our strengthened cooperation with Alibaba and third parties such as AdMaster and Nielsen in data analytical integration will further allow our key customers to realize better returns on their marketing efforts. In return, we anticipate generating increased KA ad spending.Moving on to SMEs. In third quarter, Weibo's SME ad business delivered revenue of $194.5 million, up 35%, or an increase of 39% on constant currency basis. The number of SME advertisers continue to grow. The top categories of our SME business include App downloads, O2O companies and e-commerce. Nevertheless, the recent macro and regulatory headwinds have slowed growth in several sectors, particularly in the gaming sector, which was considered as one of our top sub-industries of SME ad business with outstanding results from some of our other sub-industries during the quarter, including online education, entertainment and others.Revenue of $28.5 million from Alibaba contributed 6% of our net revenue, up 13% or an increase of 16% on a constant currency basis. Revenue from Alibaba is highly correlated with its marketing campaign and initiative spending, which can fluctuate significantly at any given quarter. Weibo occupies a unique position in Alibaba's ecosystem. We not only provide the marketing channel for Alibaba's core e-commerce business, but we also integrate into Alibaba's O2O, payment solutions, products and data integration, entertainment and video business.Value-added service revenue were $50.9 million in third quarter, up 18%, or an increase of 20% on constant currency basis. Game services declined year-over-year and it now makes up only 6% of our VAS revenue. Membership fees, which include individual memberships, enterprise account verification and V-Plus membership, were up 45%.Turning to costs and expenses. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $272.2 million, up 45%, or 43% under the old basis. Excluding the related barter transactions, marketing expenses were $108.9 million under the old basis. The increase in expense were primarily due to the increase in sales and the marketing fees as well as product development costs.We continue to taking a more focused approach to increase user acquisition and retention, as well as expand user engagement over multiple channels. As such, the non-GAAP sales and the marketing spend as a percentage of net revenue was 24% during the third quarter under the old basis, up 1% from the same period last year, and is mainly due to the increase in channel marketing spending and investments related to the promotion of Weibo Lite. The increase in product divestment expenditure was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel-related costs.Non-GAAP operating income was $188 million in third quarter, up 42%, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 41%. Income tax expense was $37.9 million, compared to $22 million last year. The increase was primarily due to the deferred tax liability recognized from the fair value changes of investments and higher profitability.Non-GAAP net income attributable to Weibo in the third quarter was $171.8 million or up 49%.Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow items. As of September 30, 2018, Weibo's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.6 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was $122.1 million. Capital expenditures totaled $6 million, while depreciation and amortization expenses amounted to $4.5 million.As leading social media platform in China, Weibo's scale and brand strength have allowed us to grow the platform efficiently. As a result, we delivered free cash flow of $116.1 million in third quarter.According to our ADR depositary firm as of September 30, 2018, approximately 28% of Weibo's share outstanding was represented by ADR shares, 86% of which were considered floating shares.Regarding acquisition of Yi's live webcasting business, as Gaofai mentioned in his remarks, the combination of Yi's live broadcasting business with Weibo will further enrich our content ecosystem, offer better support to top content creators and improve our monetization capability and efficiency, we plan to complete the acquisition process in fourth quarter.Now let me turn to our financial outlook. We anticipate our fourth quarter of 2018 revenue to be in the range of $480 million and $490 million, which assumes a foreign exchange rate of RMB 7 to USD 1, or an increase of 35% to 38% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This forecast reflects the potential impact of macro and regulatory uncertainties as well as currency translation headwinds.With that, let me now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Juan Lin, 86Research.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Juan Lin, 86Research Limited - Research Analyst [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------My first question is on your Q4 guidance. I noticed that Q4 guidance shows a slowdown compared to the third quarter in terms of growth. I'm wondering whether the guidance is mainly due to the regulatory environment change and also the macro impact on certain categories that you have already noticed, or whether you have noticed some more further impacts from the macro environment change? And how should we look at 2019?The second question is on your margin. I notice that non-GAAP operating margin actually improved versus last quarter, especially on sales and marketing expenses seem to be well controlled. So I wonder what is the future investment plan for user acquisition and how should we look at the margins going forward?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gaofei Wang, Weibo Corporation - CEO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(foreign language) I think I somewhat addressed this issue in my prepared remarks. As I indicated in my script, there are 2 main elements that are affecting our growth rate in the fourth quarter, as we indicated that our growth rate in the fourth quarter will be slower compared to the third quarter. The first element will be the macro situation, in particular for those items what was big dollar ticket size -- we're looking at industry segments such as auto segment, the travel and like big ticket items such as (foreign language) wedding services. And the other element we addressed on the call is the gaming industry. I think you are very much aware of the regulatory challenges most companies are facing these days, and that has had an impact on the marketing dollar spend on that particular industry. That impact was a lot larger than the initial estimate we had made at the beginning of the year. As a result, that could impact our growth rate in the fourth quarter. (foreign language) What I have indicated earlier, these are considered external factors.There will be a few like company-specific factors for you to consider. One, as I indicated in my remarks, during the tough period of the microeconomic situation, we are actually expanding our investments in the gaming verticals. We believe that right now, it's a good time to acquire Weibo users at a much more reasonable cost. That's one factor even though this is not too much related to the revenue growth. The other thing which I also indicated on my script is we have a significant increase to our investments in those MCN -- multi-channel network agencies -- who are being very active with Weibo. We are providing our operating inventory for them to subsidize their content creation as well as to help them to monetize. The new subsidy we have been providing to them would effectively reduce their native ad in our platform. However, we believe this would be a short-term impact. History or our past experience have been telling us that once the overall economic situation improves, those entities tend to return to their normal spending levels. This is the first question.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bonnie Zhang, Sina Corporation - CFO [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is the first question. The second, on the margin expansion question. I think we've been very disciplined in terms of our spending throughout the years. I don't think that has been a particular issue for the third quarter. If you look back to the past few quarters, as we indicated at the beginning of the year, we've been expecting our margins for the year to be relative stable on a year-over-year basis. As a result, our sales marketing absolute dollar as a percentage of revenue has been a relatively stable basis. So we do not have any particular reduction in sales and marketing or cutback of sales and marketing per se. So these are our plan. I think most of our sales and marketing expenditures from a quarter perspective. So hopefully, that answers that question. From a forward-looking point of view, I think excluding the impact from Yi Zhibo, which it's bit of different from a margin composition point of view from our normal business, our core business will continue to bear margin that's similar to the level with last year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question comes from the line of Ding Binbin from JPMorgan.Move on to the next question from Karen Chan, Jefferies.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Karen Chan, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So my first question is just wondering what general thoughts on China's social ad market growth going into 2019 and how should we think about Weibo's growth profile versus industry as peers like Tencent, they started adding more ad inventories? My second question is, any color management can provide on Yi Zhibo current monthly growth level? Or how much of a revenue contribution should we be expecting starting first quarter 2019 as a result of consolidation? That would be very helpful.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gaofei Wang, Weibo Corporation - CEO [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(foreign language) I will divide the question into 2 parts. To address your question on the social ads [all of] for 2019, starting with the brand ads. I think we look at the competitive landscape in the social ads for brand advertisers. There were limited competitors in the marketplace. And our primary competitor in this area is WeChat. (foreign language) From demand of brand advertisers, when they execute a campaign at Weibo, they are not simply looking at the cost that we are providing. They are more concerned about their brand awareness, their influence. Also, the participation of our KOLs in their distribution and amplify their brand impact. As a result, we have seen continued growth of our path from brand advertisers. And on top of that, we are further expanding our customer bases. We're looking into further going to other local brand advertiser level in 2019. (foreign language) For the growth of our brand advertisers, I think that the primary pressure is not from the competition we had with WeChat, more so it's from the market acceptance, meaning that we can acquire more marketers or brand advertisers who are willing to set up social ad products and to understand and utilize our social marketing efforts.(foreign language) On the other side, let's move on to SME side. Overall, we believe for 2019, SME growth will be a bit challenging. There's twofolds: one is with the current macro condition, the overall demand is decreasing. And on the other side, we are looking at increasing supply in traffic in the market. (foreign language) In the past few years, our growth of SME is largely depending on the growth of our traffic, and we have been paid a little bit less attention in terms of our products with social marketing features. With 2019, I think we're going to shift some of the focus into this area.(foreign language) I think we recognize this could be challenging. However, with the social platform such as Weibo and WeChat, other than providing traffic for purchase conversion, we do have advantages in terms of interactions between merchants and their fans or merchant and their followers compared to other pure media platforms. Of course, in the midst of that, we still need to have effort. We have to pay efforts in terms of the ecosystems to support the growth of SMEs but including our distributors.(foreign language) In terms of Yi live broadcasting, we just took over the Yi live broadcasting team in the month of October. For the first 2 quarters, we believe our focus will be on the product side, particular the product features with Yi live broadcasting with Weibo platform that need to be well interfaced. As a result, we have had no specific revenue forecast for 2019 on live broadcasting yet.(foreign language) I'll just give you supplemental comments on the live broadcasting. I'm sure a lot of you're aware of that the live broadcasting industry have been quite impacted by the popularity of short video in 2018. In the past, Yi live broadcasting have been focusing on the live broadcasting of showcase and KOLs. Rather, this is not an area that Weibo has significant competitive advantage compared to others. We plan to, for the first few quarters, spend more time to develop on the selected verticals or celebrity live broadcasting with Yi Zhibo so that these 2 platforms can have a better converging the efforts. Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question comes from the line of Binbin Ding from JPMorgan.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Binbin Ding, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------My first question is on your short video strategy. Can you elaborate the progress on execution of the short video strategy so far? What is the current revenue and traffic contribution from short video in the third quarter? In terms of monetization, is there any particular sectors we are going to focus at the initial stage? And also, what kind of impact will short video monetization bring to our existing KA and SME advertising revenue? My second question is quickly -- so between the live streaming and short video content, how do you prioritize your focus on investment in these 2 types of content format? And lastly, I would like to quickly ask if there any new initiatives shall we expect from your partnership with Alibaba in the next?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gaofei Wang, Weibo Corporation - CEO [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(foreign language) I think most of you are aware of that, in the last 2 years, the short video has been the primary drivers for our platform growth, both from viewership and from a user growth point of view. However, for the first half of 2018 with the popularity of few short video platforms, that has put pressure in terms of our user growth rate on the video site. (foreign language) In the third quarter, we have made adjustment in terms of user acquisitions from video content. So we will be focusing more effort in terms of the content consumption and the interactions between the content creators and the users to acquire users. And from the content type point of view, we have -- which is more focusing on the PGC content and the content with particular IP.(foreign language) In terms advertising demand, they tried to put more ad advertising material into the video format. They haven't been strictly associated their video campaign with a particular video content on the platform. As a result, you see continued favorable growth of our video advertising dollar as a percentage of our total advertising dollar. This quarter has been up 2 percentage points to 27%.(foreign language) In terms of your second question on our investment priority in between live broadcasting and short video, no doubt short video will be continued top priority for this platform. We believe the short video will be the baseline media format going forward in terms of content creation and content consumption.(foreign language) In terms of the volume of the short video and the live broadcasting -- short video creation on the platform on a daily basis, it's in the millions, while the live broadcasting might be in that 10,000. So from that volume difference, you could see what has been the dominant player. Live broadcasting will be primarily used by our top content creators, such as celebrities, as a supplemental media format for their content distributions.I think at this point of time, we have not started our particular negotiation or discussion with 2019 plan with Alibaba. So at this point, there's no indicator in terms of the further new programs we'll be working with Ali, neither there will be frame contract at advertising dollars, so we will be working with Ali for the following years.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. As there are no more further questions, I'll hand the conference to the presenter for closing remarks. Please continue.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Wen Li, Sina Corporation - Investor Relations [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining us, everyone."

""These factors have put some pressure on the growth rate of the user scale and the user engagement in the first half of 2018.""Weibo is facing these challenges by tweaking its content recommendation algorithm to improve the service's value as a distributor of trending data points.

WB,11-28-2018 06:15PM,SINA Shares Strong Growth on Weibo Ad Gains,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sina-shares-strong-growth-weibo-214000441.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.SINA Corp. (NASDAQ: SINA) announced strong third-quarter 2018 results on Wednesday morning, driven largely by the relative outperformance of advertising on its Weibo microblogging platform. At the same time, the company reduced its full-year outlook, as macroeconomic headwinds weighed on SINA's core business and smaller supplementary revenue streams.With shares climbing as much as 8% early today before settling to close up around 2%, let's take a closer look at how SINA kicked off the second half.IMAGE SOURCE: SINA.Q3 2018Q3 2017Year-Over-Year GrowthGAAP net revenue$557.2 million$433.1 million28.7%GAAP net income attributable to SINA$45.4 million$49.3 million(7.9%)GAAP net income per diluted share$0.62$0.66(6.1%)DATA SOURCE: SINA CORPORATION.

That's roughly $2.09 billion to $2.12 billion, down from SINA's prior guidance range of $2.12 billion to $2.27 billion.To be fair, Wall Street had already anticipated some weakness; going into the report, consensus estimates predicted SINA's top line this year would arrive at roughly $2.15 billion, well below the midpoint of its old range. In the end, however solid the quarter was, this explains why the stock gave back some of its early gains while still managing to close in the green as investors digested the news.More From The Motley FoolSteve Symington has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Weibo's third quarter 2018 earnings call.(Foreign Language) On today's call, I will share with you highlights of Weibo's user growth, product and monetization, as well as our key initiatives in 2018.(Foreign Language) First, let me discuss our third quarter financial results. We continued to see healthy revenue and user growth in this quarter. Our total revenue reached $460.2 million, up 44% year-over-year. Advertising and marketing revenue reached $409.3 million, up 48% year-over-year with 83% of our net revenue in Q3 from mobile. Non-GAAP operating margin during the third quarter reached 41%.(Foreign Language) On the user front, Weibo's monthly active users reached 445.9 million in September, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Additionally, the average daily active users in September reached 195.2 million, up 19% year-over-year with 93% of Weibo's MAU from mobile.(Foreign Language) Thanks to our continuous efforts to enhance the operation and distribution of a trend which are typically either hot issues or popular events discussed by users on Weibo. Weibo has further solidified its leading position as a platform for users to create and consume content. This strategy has allowed Weibo's user scale to continue to expand during the third quarter. Our focus to strengthen our software ecosystem for social interactions among users and content distribution has further increased Weibo's solid position as a social media platform and strengthened our platform effect. In return, more and more advertisers are recognizing Weibo's ability in the social marketing.(Foreign Language) In discussing our operational update for the third quarter, I will cover Weibo's progress in area of users' content and customers.(Foreign Language) First on the user growth. We see that organic growth of the mobile Internet user is slowing down and the short video industry is becoming increasingly competitive. These factors have put some pressure on the growth rate of the user scale and the user engagement in the first half of 2018. In order to face these challenges, we have refined our strategy to be more focused on taking advantage of Weibo's core capabilities in social and media areas to acquire users and promote user engagement.(Foreign Language) For example, Weibo has remained as an important platform for the discovery and distribution of trends. This has been Weibo's main differentiator to acquire new users and promote user engagement and we continue to improve this capability. This quarter we have adjusted our product operations strategy and recommendation algorithm to strengthen our competitive edge.First, we have upgraded our topic products to highlight trends with hash tags adding as points of aggregation, allowing users to discover and consume trends in multiple entry points such as our Weibo hash search and the topic feed within the discovery zone. Second, we enhanced the distribution of trends on others platforms such as Weibo's WeChat mini-program. These upgrades have encouraged more users to discover, consume, distribute, and participate in the discussion of the trends, which in return has allowed us to effectively acquire more users and promote user engagement. Notably, in Q3, the number of trends increased by triple digits sequentially and top content creators post around trends increased by double-digits on quarter-on-quarter basis.For example, in the third quarter, Super Typhoon Mangkhut, the strongest storm of 2018 and most intense typhoon to affect the region since record-keeping began, hit Guangdong province. We immediately engaged more than 100 local government agency accounts and our city ambassadors to broadcast disaster relief efforts and report the devastating effect of the typhoon and other related coverage in real time. More than 200,000 top content creators participated in the discussion in our platform, helping more people be aware of the natural disaster and support recovery efforts. Over a seven-day period, number of impressions on the topic Typhoon Mangkhut reached 7.3 billion, which resulted in an increase of millions of daily active users.(Foreign Language) Moving to the feeds product, our focus have always been on enhancing social content production and maintaining the user's social relations as the top priority for content distribution. Our goal is to amplify the platform for social features and to distinguish ourselves from the market. During the past few years, the competitive landscape of information feed and short videos have increased in the mobile Internet industry. Both have been the key drivers for user growth and our main focus around product development.(Foreign Language) Our two years of product development and enhancements have been paying off. Weibo's relationship-based feed and interest-based feed users scale and user consumption have grown rapidly, and have gained popularity among users to consume content. This quarter, user engagement rate of relationship-based feeds, as well as user consumption of interest-based feeds, both achieved a healthy growth on a sequential basis.(Foreign Language) Meanwhile, with video, viral as a PGC or UGC (ph) format has become an important and growing area within our content ecosystems, and we have achieved a meaningful progress with our video products. In September, there were short video views and posts grew by double-digits from last year. Weibo Stories' monthly active users and daily Stories viewerships both achieved healthy growth on a sequential basis.(Foreign Language) The short video market has become increasingly competitive. In order to best position Weibo for success and sustain our long-term competitiveness, we are increasing investment in our user products to feature Weibo's unique advantages in content creation, consumption, and users' social interaction, so we can improve user acquisition efficiency.(Foreign Language) This quarter, we built out a new version of Weibo app beyond initial test for users. Compared to the old version, we made two primary modifications. First, we have created a video chat named Weibo video community, allowing users to access video content at a primary entry point, and featuring premium video content with IP and programs in series such as our daily vlog, makeup tutorials or set of videos with recurring characters or themes. We intend to cultivate habits for users to discover premium videos more efficiently, and connect and interact with those creators a lot. So the viral distribution of short video is showing great promise in the increase of user viewership, and advertising inventory. By leveraging our core capabilities in content distribution and fans' social connectivity, we think the video community will further help driving the growth of our video user scale and the user time spent, as it will be a designated center stage to a wide range of premium videos and a platform for users to connect and interact with each other and with content creators.(Foreign Language) Further, on the user products, we have optimized our discovery zone to further strengthen our competitive edge in the discovery and discussion of the trends. We have structured the topics feeds and provide users' personal life recommendation on topics they might be interesting, helping to promote user discussion around topics. We have integrated topic products seamlessly into Weibo's hot search. On the one hand, any content on the hot search that have been formed as a topic will be assigned with the separate topic page. Users not only could discover what are hot and new controversial content on the hot search and they will be also able to view other valuable information including discussions, videos, articles and others based on that topic page. On the other hand, as more users discover, consume, share, distribute, and participate in the discussion of a particular issue or event, the hot issue or popular event could become the hottest topic on the hot search, and eventually go viral on Weibo. This integration represents the information reinforcing that effectively extends user content consumption for a longer period.(Foreign Language) We believe this upgrade is vital to further strengthen Weibo's uniqueness in social media markets, especially in the creation and consumption of video content and distribution of trends. It is also a key driver to accelerate Weibo's future growth. The new version will be available to our users in the coming quarters, based on the product optimization progress and the users' feed back.(Foreign Language) Moving to live broadcasting, our strategic investment in live broadcasting has solidified our leading edge in the live broadcasting market for media and celebrity vertical. Given the current competitive landscape of live broadcasting, we plan to acquire Yi's live broadcasting business in Q4. Our goal is to provide Weibo's users with improved live broadcasting experience, by enabling better product integration between Weibo and Yi that focus in media, celebrity, and showcase vertical. Ultimately, this acquisition is intended to increase traffic and revenues to Weibo's platform. Once the acquisition process is completed, it will take us one or two quarters to fully integrate and optimize product. We believe the combination of Yi's live broadcasting business with Weibo will further enrich our content ecosystem, offer better support to top content creators, and improve our monetization capability and efficiencies.(Foreign Language) Moving on to content, in the third quarter we expanded strategic cooperation with over 2,200 MCNs. Top content creators posts as well as post views maintained double-digit growth from the last year, representing higher engagement of top content creators on Weibo. Weibo has become the inevitable platform for top content creators, primarily because of the following two reasons.(Foreign Language) First, as I mentioned last quarter, more and more KOLs have recognized Weibo's uniqueness for other content offering platforms. During this year, our short video platforms became more popular among users. Many content creators returned to Weibo after establishing a baseline of influence and becoming top content creators on other platforms. Weibo is recognized as the ultimate platform for KOLs to expand their audience reach and further gain public influence, whereby generating better monetization. In Q3, the number of top content creators from other platforms that returned to Weibo increased to nearly three times sequentially. Those returned top content creators have been actively creating content.(Foreign Language) Second, we value the top content creators' experience and growth on Weibo. We have largely increased traffic support and subsidies to help top content creators monetize their content. For example, in Q3, we have provided more than RMB500 million worth of advertising inventory as a subsidy to support top content creators to grow. At the same time, Weibo has allowed more top content creators to more effectively monetize those social assets (inaudible) Weibo advertising alliance program. As a result, the average number of posts generated by those content creators who entitle with our revenue sharing increased double-digit.The considerable subsidies we are providing might temporarily restrain the demand of our native app on the platform, thus affecting our short-term financial performance. However, based on our proven track record of successful cases, we believe its more important to help top content creators grow on Weibo and accumulate social assets and be able to monetize our platform over the longer run. We believe our strategy will facilitate top content creators greater incentives to create higher quality content, enhance user acquisition and user engagement and further broaden Weibo's content ecosystem. All of this will in return help our long-term sustainable growth of our future monetization.(Foreign Language) Lastly, financial monetization. We achieved healthy revenue growth in the third quarter. This quarter KA revenue increased 73% year-over-year. More and more advertisers do not just pass their marketing content on Weibo, they have increasingly realized Weibo's unique value of social marketing and the power of leveraging our content distribution and then the KOLs' influence. In short, they have to consider Weibo as a strategic partner. This achievement could not be made without Weibo's continuous investment in the innovation and optimization of our monetization products. Our focus to strengthen the strategic cooperation with third-party help KA customer better recognize Weibo's marking value, and enable them to have a better marketing experience.Separately, the Weibo uni-marketing program, our cooperation with -- collaboration with Alibaba launched in Q2 have made impressive progress this quarter. Currently, more than hundreds of brand advertisers have joined the program and are benefiting from its broad reach. For example , after joining the Weibo uni-marketing program, Dyson was able to more precisely identify the target potential customers by leveraging the existing customer base of Weibo and Ali. After the marketing campaign, users' favorability of Dyson's vacuum increased 43%. Moreover, data confirmed that more a user interacts with the Dyson app on Weibo, the higher possibility the user will make a purchase through Dyson's Tmall store.(Foreign Language) Turning to SME. In the third quarter, SME revenue were up 35% year-over-year. However, our SME app business compounded challenges in the following two aspects.(Foreign Language) First, macroeconomic headwinds are expected to continue in the near future, which have already led to a decrease in merchant advertising spending in our field vertical industries such as out of services, wedding business, and other consumer sectors with large ticket size and with a focus on targeting users in the first and second-tier cities.(Foreign Language) Second, the gaming industry has been one of our top sector of SME app business. However, the recent regulatory changes in the gaming industry had a significant impact on marketing demand of gaming companies. We expect the regulatory impact and the length of supervision lasting longer than we expected.(Foreign Language) In response to these challenges, we have made strategic adjustments by focusing on the following three aspects.(Foreign Language) First, we have adjusted the structure and the focus of our sales teams proactively seek for more opportunities to expand the customer base, including regional brand customers and deploy tailored products and marketing solutions to advertisers across more verticals. Notably, we made a meaningful progress in the online education sector in this quarter. Revenue contributed by this sector increased by triple digits year-over-year.(Foreign Language) Additionally, we tend to further subsidize MCNs and top content creators to grow and monetize on Weibo under the current macroeconomics condition as they are one of our unique assets help Weibo differentiate from other platforms. Our process support and investments have enabled large amount of MCNs and top content creators to grow rapidly on Weibo in the past few years. The considerable subsidies we provided might temporarily restrain the demand of our native app on the platform, thus affecting our short-term financial performance. However, we believe our investment will benefit Weibo's overall ecosystem in the long run.(Foreign Language) Plus, although we expect the gaming sector's revenue contribution will decline in the short-term, we insist on increasing the investment to strengthen the operation of gaming vertical on Weibo. On the one hand, we believe the resources we invested in the gaming vertical will enable us to acquire younger users at a lower cost, while the gaming industry is currently in the adjustment cycle. And in the longer term, we expect it will bring us corresponding returns after the industry returns back to normal. Notably, in this summer, we acquired many users in the gaming vertical through a series of activity and events.(Foreign Language) Overall, we have encountered challenges to grow our SME business in the second half of the year, including the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on selected industry segments, and the short and medium-term impact of regulatory and economic policy changes on gaming. However, we will continue to invest in expanding customer base from resilient industries, supporting MCNs and top content creators to build a better monetization ecosystem, developing more verticals that users will be interested in. All of this will, in return, help us to promote the growth of Weibo's SME ad business in the longer-term.(Foreign Language) With that, let me turn the call over to Fei Cao for a financial update.Fei Cao -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Gaofei. Welcome to Weibo's third quarter 2018 earnings call. As a remainder, we adopted ASC Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, and our new revenue guidance is consistent with this standard. In order to provide investors with clear comparisons during today's call, I will also refer to our revenue and expense figure under the old revenue guidance, which exclude barter transactions and include value-added tax, to the reported figures in our earnings release.Now, let me walk you through our financial highlights. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Weibo's third quarter net revenue was $460.2 million, up 44%, or 43% under the old accounting standard, or an increase of 48% on a constant currency basis. Strong advertiser revenue growth was offset by the recent regulatory changes in certain verticals, particularly in the gaming industry, which led to a decrease in merchant advertising spending during the quarter, especially for SMEs. We expect these regulatory adjustments may continue to affect growth of this vertical's advertising spend in the near term.In addition, the continued depreciation of RMB related to US dollar had an unfavorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter, and we expect foreign currency headwinds to continue in the near term. Non-GAAP operating income reached $188 million, up 42%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Weibo was $171.8 million, up 49%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.75 compared to $0.51 a year ago.Advertising and the marketing revenue for the third quarter reached $409.3 million, up 48%, or an increase of 52% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue in the third quarter was $341.6 million, (ph) up 58%, representing 82% of our total ad revenue. Our focus to strengthen our platform ecosystems in users' social interaction and content distribution has further increased Weibo's value proposition as a social media platform, and strengthen the platform effect. Thereby, we continue to benefit from the shift in corporate ad spending toward mobile, social, and video with 93% of MAUs from mobile in September. As a result, we are pleased to see that our total advertisers continue to grow from the last quarter.Turning to KA, in the third quarter, our KA ad revenue reached 136.2 million, (ph) up 73%, or an increase of 78% on a constant currency basis. This strong KA advertising revenue growth was driven by both an increase in ARPA and the expansion of Weibo's key advertiser base. Weibo is tracking key advertisers of all backgrounds based on social relationships combined with the competitive differentiators we have with our unique celebrity assets, KOLs, network effect, content diversity, and integrated marketing solution. (inaudible) we continue to see (inaudible) growth in Weibo's top take industries, with FMCG and IT, electronics, telecom namely firstly growing at triple digit year-over-year. In addition, I will stress the cooperation with Alibaba and third parties such as AB Master and Nielsen in data analytical integration will further allow our key customers to realize better return on their marketing efforts. In return, we anticipate generating increased KA ad spending.Moving on to SMEs, in third quarter, Weibo's SME ad business delivered revenue of $194.5 million, up 35%, or an increase of 39% on a constant currency basis. The number of SME advertisers continued to grow. The top categories of our SME business include app downloads, O2O companies and e-commerce. Nevertheless, the recent macro and regulatory headwinds have slowed growth in several sectors, particularly the gaming sector, which was considered as one of our top industries of SME ad business with outstanding results from some of our top industries during the quarter, including online education, entertainment and others.Revenue of $28.5 million from Alibaba contributed 6% of our net revenue, up 13% or an increase of 16% on a constant currency basis. Revenue from Alibaba is highly correlated with its marketing campaign and initiatives spending, which can fluctuate significantly in any given quarter. Weibo also has a unique position in Alibaba's ecosystem. We not only provide marketing channel for Alibaba's core e-commerce business, but we're also integrated into Alibaba's O2O payment solutions, products, and video integration, entertainment and video businesses. Value-added service, VAS, revenue was $15.9 million in third quarter, up 18% or an increase of 20% on a constant currency basis. Game services declined year-over-year, and it now makes up only 6% of our VAS revenues. Membership fees, which include individual memberships, enterprise account verification, and V-plus membership, were up 45%.Turning to cost and expenses, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $272.2 million, up 45% or 43% under the old basis. Excluding the related barter transactions, marketing expenses were $108.9 million under the old basis. The increase in expense was primarily due to the increase in sales and the marketing fees, as well as product development costs. We continue to taking a more focused approach to increase user acquisition and retention, as well as expand user engagement over multiple channels. As such, the non-GAAP sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue was 24% during the third quarter under the old basis, up 1% from the same period last year, and it's mainly due to the increase in channel marketing spending and the investments relating to the promotion of Weibo Lite. The increase in product development expenditure was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel-related cost.Non-GAAP operating income was 188 million in third quarter, up 42% representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 41%. Income tax expense was $37.9 million compared to $22 million last year. The increase was primarily due to the deferred tax liabilities recognized from the fair value changes of investments and higher profitability. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Weibo in the third quarter was $171.8 million or up 49%.Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow items, as of September 30, 2018, Weibo's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $1.6 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was $122.1 million. Capital expenditures totaled $6 million, while depreciation and amortization expenses amounted to $4.5 million. As a leading social media platform in China, Weibo's scale and brand strength have allowed us to grow the platform efficiently. As a result, we delivered free cash flow of 116.1 million (ph) in third quarter.According to our ADR Depositary Form, as of September 30, 2018, approximately 28% of Weibo's share outstanding were represented by ADR shares, 86% of which were considered floating shares. Regarding the acquisition of Yi's live broadcasting business, as Gaofei mentioned in his remarks, the combination of Yi's live broadcasting business with Weibo will further enrich our content ecosystem, offer better support to top content creators, and improve our monetization capability and efficiency. We plan to complete the acquisition process in fourth quarter.Now let me turn to our financial outlook. We anticipate our first quarter of 2018 revenue to be in the range of $480 million and $490 million, which assumes a foreign exchange rate of RMB7 to $1, or an increase of 35% to 38% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This forecast lacks the potential impact of matters and regulatory uncertainties as well as currency translation headwinds.With that, let me now turn the floor over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Juan Lin, 86Research. Please ask your question.Juan Lin -- 86Research -- AnalystThank you, management. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on your Q4 guidance. I notice that the Q4 guidance shows a slowdown compared to the third quarter in terms of growth, I'm wondering whether the guidance is mainly due to the regulatory environment change and also the macro impact on certain categories that you have already noticed or whether you have noticed some more for the impact from the macro environment change and how should we look at 2019? The second question is on your margins. I notice that non-GAAP operating margin actually improved versus last quarter, especially sales and marketing expenses seem to be well controlled. So I wonder what is future investment plan for user acquisition and how should we look at margins going forward? Thank you.Gaofei Wang -- Chief Executive Officer(Foreign Language) I think I addressed somewhat just this issue in my prepared remarks. From -- as I indicated in my script, there's two main elements that are affecting our growth rate in the fourth quarter as you have -- we indicated that our growth rate in the fourth quarter will be slower compared to the third quarter. The first element will be the macro situation, and particular for those items with big dollar ticket size in the -- we're looking at industry segments such as auto segment with the travel and like big ticket item such as wedding services. And the other element we -- I addressed on the call is the gaming industry. I think you are very much aware of the regulatory challenges most companies are facing these days and that has had an impact on the marketing dollars spent on that particular industry. That impact was larger than the initial estimates we had made at the beginning of the year. As a result, that could impact our growth rate in the fourth quarter.(Foreign Language) What I have indicated earlier, these we will consider external factors. There will be few like company-specific factors for you to consider. One, as I indicated in my remarks, during the tough period of the macroeconomic situation, we are doing -- we are actually expanding our investments in the gaming verticals. We believe that right now it's a good time to acquire users, Weibo users at a much more reasonable cost. That's one factor, even though this is not too much related to the revenue growth. The other thing which I also indicated on my script is we have significantly increased our investments in those MCN multi-channel network agencies who are actively -- who are being very active with Weibo. We are providing our operating inventory for them to subsidize their content creation as well as to help them to monetize. The new subsidy we have been providing to them would effectively reduce their native app's demand on our platform. However, we believe these would be a short-term impact. Our history or our past experience have been telling us that, these things, once the overall economic situation improves, those entities tend to return to their normal spending levels. This is the first question.The second, on the margin expansion question, I think we've been very much -- been very disciplined in terms of our spending throughout the years. I don't think that has been a particular issue for the third quarter. If you look back to the past few quarters, as we indicated at the beginning of the year, we have been expecting our margins for the year be relative stable on a year-over-year basis. As a result, our sales growth -- our sales and marketing on absolute dollar as a percentage of revenue has been a relative stable basis. So we do not have any particular reduction in sales marketing or cutback of sales marketing per se. So these are our plans. I think most of our sales and marketing expenditures were planned ahead from a quarter perspective. So hopefully that answers that question.From a forward-looking point of view, I think excluding the impact from Yizhibo which is a bit of a different from margin compensation point of view from our normal business, I think our core business will continue to bear margin that's similar to the level with last year.Juan Lin -- 86Research -- AnalystThank you very much. That's very helpful.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ding Binbin from JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Moving on to the next question from Karen Chan, Jefferies. Please ask your question.Karen Chan -- Jefferies -- AnalystThank you, management, for taking my question. So my first question is, just wondering what's the general thoughts on China's social ad market growth going into 2019, and how should we think about Weibo's growth profile versus industry as peers like Tencent, they start adding more ad inventories? My second question is, any color management can provide on each Yizhibo current monthly grossing level or how much of a revenue contribution should we be expecting starting first quarter 2019 as a result of consolidation? That would be very helpful. Thank you.Gaofei Wang -- Chief Executive Officer(Foreign Language) I would divide the question into, I guess, two parts, to address your question on the social ads outlook for 2019. Starting with the brand ads, I think we look at the competitive landscape in the social ads for brand advertisers, there are limited competitors in the marketplace and our primary competitors in this area is WeChat.(Foreign Language) From demand of brand advertiser in terms they execute a campaign at Weibo, they are not simply looking at the traffic we are providing. They are more concerned about their brand influence, brand awareness, their influence, also the participation of our KOL in their distribution and amplify their brand impact. As a result, we have seen continued growth of our ARPA from our brand advertisers. And on top of that, we are further expanding our customer bases, where we're looking into further going to at a local brand advertiser level in 2019.(Foreign Language) For a brand, the growth of our brand advertisers, I think that the primary pressure is not from the competition we had with WeChat. More so, it's from the market acceptance, meaning that we can acquire more marketers to our brand advertisers who are willing to accept our social ad products and to understand and utilize our social marketing efforts.(Foreign Language) On the other side, let's move onto SME side. Overall, we believe for 2019, SME growth will be a bit of a challenging. There's twofold. One is with the current macro condition, the overall demand is decreasing and on the other side, we're looking at increasing supply in traffic in the market.(Foreign Language) In the past few years, our growth of SME has largely depending on the growth on our traffic and we have been paid a little bit less attention in terms of our product with the social marketing features. With 2019, I think we're going to shift some of the focus into this area.(Foreign Language) I think we recognized this could be challenging. However, with these social platforms such as Weibo and WeChat, other than providing traffic for purchase conversion, we do have advantages in terms of interaction between merchant and their fans or merchants and their followers compared to other pure media platforms. Of course, in the midst of that, we still need to have -- we have to pay efforts in terms of the ecosystem to support the growth at SMEs, that including our distributors.(Foreign Language) In terms of the Yi live broadcasting, we just take over -- just took over the Yi live broadcasting team in the month of October. For the first two quarters, we believe our focus will be on the product side, particular the product features with Yi live broadcasting with few -- with our Weibo platform that need to be well interfaced. As a result, we have had no specific revenue forecast for 2019 on live broadcasting yet.(Foreign Language) Just to give you supplemental comments on the live broadcasting, I'm sure a lot of you are aware of that. The live broadcasting industry have been quite impacted by the popularity of short video in 2018. In the past the Yi live broadcasting have been focusing on the live broadcasting of showcase and KOLs. Rather, this is not an area that Weibo has significant competitive advantage compared to others. We plan to, for the first few quarters, spend more time to develop on the selected verticals or celebrity live broadcasting with Yizhibo, so that these two platforms can have better converging efforts.Thank you.Karen Chan -- Jefferies -- AnalystVery much -- very helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ding Binbin from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.Binbin Ding -- JPMorgan -- AnalystHi, good evening, management. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on strong third quarter results. My first question is on your short video strategy. So can you elaborate the progress on execution of the short video strategy so far? What is the current revenue and traffic contribution from short video in the third quarter? In terms of monetization, is there any particular sectors factored into focus at the initial stage? And also what kind of impact will short video monetization bring to our existing KA and SME advertising revenue? My second question is, quickly -- so between the live streaming and short video content, how do you prioritize your focus on the investment in these two type of content formats? And lastly, I would like to quickly ask if there any new initiatives that we expect from your partnership with Alibaba in the next year? Thank you.Gaofei Wang -- Chief Executive Officer(Foreign Language) I think, most of you aware that in the last two years, the short video has been the primary drivers of our platform growth, both from viewership and from a user growth point of view. However, for the first half of 2018 with the popularity of few short video platforms that has put pressure in terms of user growth rates on the video side.(Foreign Language) In the third quarter, we have made adjustment in terms of user acquisition from video content. So we will be focusing more effort in terms of the content consumption and interactions between the content creators and the users to acquire users. And from the content type and on the content type point of view, we have switched more focusing on the PTC content, and the content with particular IP.(Foreign Language) In terms of advertising demand, rather they try to put more advertising material into the video format. They haven't been strictly associated their video campaign with particular video content on the platform. As a result, you see continued stable growth of our video advertising dollar as a percentage of our total advertising dollar. This quarter has been up 2 percentage points to 27%.(Foreign Language) In terms of your second question, our investment priority in between live broadcasting and short video, no doubt short video will continue the top priority for this platform. We believe short video will be the baseline media format going forward in terms of content creation and content consumption.(Foreign Language) In terms of the volume of the short video and live broadcasting, short video creation on the platform on a daily basis is in the millions, while the live broadcasting might be in the 10,000. So from that volume difference you could see who has been the dominant player. Live broadcasting will be primarily used by our top content creators such as celebrities as a supplemental media format for their content distributions.I think, at this point of time, we have not started our particular negotiation or discussion with 2019 plan with Alibaba. So we have no -- at this point, there's no indicator in terms of the further new programs we'll be working with Ali. Neither, there will be the firm contracting advertising dollars. So we'll be working with Ali for the following years.Binbin Ding -- JPMorgan -- AnalystThank you.OperatorThank you.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Weibo's third quarter 2018 earnings call.(Foreign Language) On today's call, I will share with you highlights of Weibo's user growth, product and monetization, as well as our key initiatives in 2018.(Foreign Language) First, let me discuss our third quarter financial results. We continued to see healthy revenue and user growth in this quarter. Our total revenue reached $460.2 million, up 44% year-over-year. Advertising and marketing revenue reached $409.3 million, up 48% year-over-year with 83% of our net revenue in Q3 from mobile. Non-GAAP operating margin during the third quarter reached 41%.(Foreign Language) On the user front, Weibo's monthly active users reached 445.9 million in September, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Additionally, the average daily active users in September reached 195.2 million, up 19% year-over-year with 93% of Weibo's MAU from mobile.(Foreign Language) Thanks to our continuous efforts to enhance the operation and distribution of a trend which are typically either hot issues or popular events discussed by users on Weibo. Weibo has further solidified its leading position as a platform for users to create and consume content. This strategy has allowed Weibo's user scale to continue to expand during the third quarter. Our focus to strengthen our software ecosystem for social interactions among users and content distribution has further increased Weibo's solid position as a social media platform and strengthened our platform effect. In return, more and more advertisers are recognizing Weibo's ability in the social marketing.(Foreign Language) In discussing our operational update for the third quarter, I will cover Weibo's progress in area of users' content and customers.(Foreign Language) First on the user growth. We see that organic growth of the mobile Internet user is slowing down and the short video industry is becoming increasingly competitive. These factors have put some pressure on the growth rate of the user scale and the user engagement in the first half of 2018. In order to face these challenges, we have refined our strategy to be more focused on taking advantage of Weibo's core capabilities in social and media areas to acquire users and promote user engagement.(Foreign Language) For example, Weibo has remained as an important platform for the discovery and distribution of trends. This has been Weibo's main differentiator to acquire new users and promote user engagement and we continue to improve this capability. This quarter we have adjusted our product operations strategy and recommendation algorithm to strengthen our competitive edge.First, we have upgraded our topic products to highlight trends with hash tags adding as points of aggregation, allowing users to discover and consume trends in multiple entry points such as our Weibo hash search and the topic feed within the discovery zone. Second, we enhanced the distribution of trends on others platforms such as Weibo's WeChat mini-program. These upgrades have encouraged more users to discover, consume, distribute, and participate in the discussion of the trends, which in return has allowed us to effectively acquire more users and promote user engagement. Notably, in Q3, the number of trends increased by triple digits sequentially and top content creators post around trends increased by double-digits on quarter-on-quarter basis.For example, in the third quarter, Super Typhoon Mangkhut, the strongest storm of 2018 and most intense typhoon to affect the region since record-keeping began, hit Guangdong province. We immediately engaged more than 100 local government agency accounts and our city ambassadors to broadcast disaster relief efforts and report the devastating effect of the typhoon and other related coverage in real time. More than 200,000 top content creators participated in the discussion in our platform, helping more people be aware of the natural disaster and support recovery efforts. Over a seven-day period, number of impressions on the topic Typhoon Mangkhut reached 7.3 billion, which resulted in an increase of millions of daily active users.(Foreign Language) Moving to the feeds product, our focus have always been on enhancing social content production and maintaining the user's social relations as the top priority for content distribution. Our goal is to amplify the platform for social features and to distinguish ourselves from the market. During the past few years, the competitive landscape of information feed and short videos have increased in the mobile Internet industry. Both have been the key drivers for user growth and our main focus around product development.(Foreign Language) Our two years of product development and enhancements have been paying off. Weibo's relationship-based feed and interest-based feed users scale and user consumption have grown rapidly, and have gained popularity among users to consume content. This quarter, user engagement rate of relationship-based feeds, as well as user consumption of interest-based feeds, both achieved a healthy growth on a sequential basis.(Foreign Language) Meanwhile, with video, viral as a PGC or UGC (ph) format has become an important and growing area within our content ecosystems, and we have achieved a meaningful progress with our video products. In September, there were short video views and posts grew by double-digits from last year. Weibo Stories' monthly active users and daily Stories viewerships both achieved healthy growth on a sequential basis.(Foreign Language) The short video market has become increasingly competitive. In order to best position Weibo for success and sustain our long-term competitiveness, we are increasing investment in our user products to feature Weibo's unique advantages in content creation, consumption, and users' social interaction, so we can improve user acquisition efficiency.(Foreign Language) This quarter, we built out a new version of Weibo app beyond initial test for users. Compared to the old version, we made two primary modifications. First, we have created a video chat named Weibo video community, allowing users to access video content at a primary entry point, and featuring premium video content with IP and programs in series such as our daily vlog, makeup tutorials or set of videos with recurring characters or themes. We intend to cultivate habits for users to discover premium videos more efficiently, and connect and interact with those creators a lot. So the viral distribution of short video is showing great promise in the increase of user viewership, and advertising inventory. By leveraging our core capabilities in content distribution and fans' social connectivity, we think the video community will further help driving the growth of our video user scale and the user time spent, as it will be a designated center stage to a wide range of premium videos and a platform for users to connect and interact with each other and with content creators.(Foreign Language) Further, on the user products, we have optimized our discovery zone to further strengthen our competitive edge in the discovery and discussion of the trends. We have structured the topics feeds and provide users' personal life recommendation on topics they might be interesting, helping to promote user discussion around topics. We have integrated topic products seamlessly into Weibo's hot search. On the one hand, any content on the hot search that have been formed as a topic will be assigned with the separate topic page. Users not only could discover what are hot and new controversial content on the hot search and they will be also able to view other valuable information including discussions, videos, articles and others based on that topic page. On the other hand, as more users discover, consume, share, distribute, and participate in the discussion of a particular issue or event, the hot issue or popular event could become the hottest topic on the hot search, and eventually go viral on Weibo. This integration represents the information reinforcing that effectively extends user content consumption for a longer period.(Foreign Language) We believe this upgrade is vital to further strengthen Weibo's uniqueness in social media markets, especially in the creation and consumption of video content and distribution of trends. It is also a key driver to accelerate Weibo's future growth. The new version will be available to our users in the coming quarters, based on the product optimization progress and the users' feed back.(Foreign Language) Moving to live broadcasting, our strategic investment in live broadcasting has solidified our leading edge in the live broadcasting market for media and celebrity vertical. Given the current competitive landscape of live broadcasting, we plan to acquire Yi's live broadcasting business in Q4. Our goal is to provide Weibo's users with improved live broadcasting experience, by enabling better product integration between Weibo and Yi that focus in media, celebrity, and showcase vertical. Ultimately, this acquisition is intended to increase traffic and revenues to Weibo's platform. Once the acquisition process is completed, it will take us one or two quarters to fully integrate and optimize product. We believe the combination of Yi's live broadcasting business with Weibo will further enrich our content ecosystem, offer better support to top content creators, and improve our monetization capability and efficiencies.(Foreign Language) Moving on to content, in the third quarter we expanded strategic cooperation with over 2,200 MCNs. Top content creators posts as well as post views maintained double-digit growth from the last year, representing higher engagement of top content creators on Weibo. Weibo has become the inevitable platform for top content creators, primarily because of the following two reasons.(Foreign Language) First, as I mentioned last quarter, more and more KOLs have recognized Weibo's uniqueness for other content offering platforms. During this year, our short video platforms became more popular among users. Many content creators returned to Weibo after establishing a baseline of influence and becoming top content creators on other platforms. Weibo is recognized as the ultimate platform for KOLs to expand their audience reach and further gain public influence, whereby generating better monetization. In Q3, the number of top content creators from other platforms that returned to Weibo increased to nearly three times sequentially. Those returned top content creators have been actively creating content.(Foreign Language) Second, we value the top content creators' experience and growth on Weibo. We have largely increased traffic support and subsidies to help top content creators monetize their content. For example, in Q3, we have provided more than RMB500 million worth of advertising inventory as a subsidy to support top content creators to grow. At the same time, Weibo has allowed more top content creators to more effectively monetize those social assets (inaudible) Weibo advertising alliance program. As a result, the average number of posts generated by those content creators who entitle with our revenue sharing increased double-digit.The considerable subsidies we are providing might temporarily restrain the demand of our native app on the platform, thus affecting our short-term financial performance. However, based on our proven track record of successful cases, we believe its more important to help top content creators grow on Weibo and accumulate social assets and be able to monetize our platform over the longer run. We believe our strategy will facilitate top content creators greater incentives to create higher quality content, enhance user acquisition and user engagement and further broaden Weibo's content ecosystem. All of this will in return help our long-term sustainable growth of our future monetization.(Foreign Language) Lastly, financial monetization. We achieved healthy revenue growth in the third quarter. This quarter KA revenue increased 73% year-over-year. More and more advertisers do not just pass their marketing content on Weibo, they have increasingly realized Weibo's unique value of social marketing and the power of leveraging our content distribution and then the KOLs' influence. In short, they have to consider Weibo as a strategic partner. This achievement could not be made without Weibo's continuous investment in the innovation and optimization of our monetization products. Our focus to strengthen the strategic cooperation with third-party help KA customer better recognize Weibo's marking value, and enable them to have a better marketing experience.Separately, the Weibo uni-marketing program, our cooperation with -- collaboration with Alibaba launched in Q2 have made impressive progress this quarter. Currently, more than hundreds of brand advertisers have joined the program and are benefiting from its broad reach. For example , after joining the Weibo uni-marketing program, Dyson was able to more precisely identify the target potential customers by leveraging the existing customer base of Weibo and Ali. After the marketing campaign, users' favorability of Dyson's vacuum increased 43%. Moreover, data confirmed that more a user interacts with the Dyson app on Weibo, the higher possibility the user will make a purchase through Dyson's Tmall store.(Foreign Language) Turning to SME. In the third quarter, SME revenue were up 35% year-over-year. However, our SME app business compounded challenges in the following two aspects.(Foreign Language) First, macroeconomic headwinds are expected to continue in the near future, which have already led to a decrease in merchant advertising spending in our field vertical industries such as out of services, wedding business, and other consumer sectors with large ticket size and with a focus on targeting users in the first and second-tier cities.(Foreign Language) Second, the gaming industry has been one of our top sector of SME app business. However, the recent regulatory changes in the gaming industry had a significant impact on marketing demand of gaming companies. We expect the regulatory impact and the length of supervision lasting longer than we expected.(Foreign Language) In response to these challenges, we have made strategic adjustments by focusing on the following three aspects.(Foreign Language) First, we have adjusted the structure and the focus of our sales teams proactively seek for more opportunities to expand the customer base, including regional brand customers and deploy tailored products and marketing solutions to advertisers across more verticals. Notably, we made a meaningful progress in the online education sector in this quarter. Revenue contributed by this sector increased by triple digits year-over-year.(Foreign Language) Additionally, we tend to further subsidize MCNs and top content creators to grow and monetize on Weibo under the current macroeconomics condition as they are one of our unique assets help Weibo differentiate from other platforms. Our process support and investments have enabled large amount of MCNs and top content creators to grow rapidly on Weibo in the past few years. The considerable subsidies we provided might temporarily restrain the demand of our native app on the platform, thus affecting our short-term financial performance. However, we believe our investment will benefit Weibo's overall ecosystem in the long run.(Foreign Language) Plus, although we expect the gaming sector's revenue contribution will decline in the short-term, we insist on increasing the investment to strengthen the operation of gaming vertical on Weibo. On the one hand, we believe the resources we invested in the gaming vertical will enable us to acquire younger users at a lower cost, while the gaming industry is currently in the adjustment cycle. And in the longer term, we expect it will bring us corresponding returns after the industry returns back to normal. Notably, in this summer, we acquired many users in the gaming vertical through a series of activity and events.(Foreign Language) Overall, we have encountered challenges to grow our SME business in the second half of the year, including the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on selected industry segments, and the short and medium-term impact of regulatory and economic policy changes on gaming. However, we will continue to invest in expanding customer base from resilient industries, supporting MCNs and top content creators to build a better monetization ecosystem, developing more verticals that users will be interested in. All of this will, in return, help us to promote the growth of Weibo's SME ad business in the longer-term.(Foreign Language) With that, let me turn the call over to Fei Cao for a financial update.Fei Cao -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Gaofei. Welcome to Weibo's third quarter 2018 earnings call. As a remainder, we adopted ASC Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, and our new revenue guidance is consistent with this standard. In order to provide investors with clear comparisons during today's call, I will also refer to our revenue and expense figure under the old revenue guidance, which exclude barter transactions and include value-added tax, to the reported figures in our earnings release.Now, let me walk you through our financial highlights. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Weibo's third quarter net revenue was $460.2 million, up 44%, or 43% under the old accounting standard, or an increase of 48% on a constant currency basis. Strong advertiser revenue growth was offset by the recent regulatory changes in certain verticals, particularly in the gaming industry, which led to a decrease in merchant advertising spending during the quarter, especially for SMEs. We expect these regulatory adjustments may continue to affect growth of this vertical's advertising spend in the near term.In addition, the continued depreciation of RMB related to US dollar had an unfavorable impact on revenue growth during the quarter, and we expect foreign currency headwinds to continue in the near term. Non-GAAP operating income reached $188 million, up 42%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Weibo was $171.8 million, up 49%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.75 compared to $0.51 a year ago.Advertising and the marketing revenue for the third quarter reached $409.3 million, up 48%, or an increase of 52% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue in the third quarter was $341.6 million, (ph) up 58%, representing 82% of our total ad revenue. Our focus to strengthen our platform ecosystems in users' social interaction and content distribution has further increased Weibo's value proposition as a social media platform, and strengthen the platform effect. Thereby, we continue to benefit from the shift in corporate ad spending toward mobile, social, and video with 93% of MAUs from mobile in September. As a result, we are pleased to see that our total advertisers continue to grow from the last quarter.Turning to KA, in the third quarter, our KA ad revenue reached 136.2 million, (ph) up 73%, or an increase of 78% on a constant currency basis. This strong KA advertising revenue growth was driven by both an increase in ARPA and the expansion of Weibo's key advertiser base. Weibo is tracking key advertisers of all backgrounds based on social relationships combined with the competitive differentiators we have with our unique celebrity assets, KOLs, network effect, content diversity, and integrated marketing solution. (inaudible) we continue to see (inaudible) growth in Weibo's top take industries, with FMCG and IT, electronics, telecom namely firstly growing at triple digit year-over-year. In addition, I will stress the cooperation with Alibaba and third parties such as AB Master and Nielsen in data analytical integration will further allow our key customers to realize better return on their marketing efforts. In return, we anticipate generating increased KA ad spending.Moving on to SMEs, in third quarter, Weibo's SME ad business delivered revenue of $194.5 million, up 35%, or an increase of 39% on a constant currency basis. The number of SME advertisers continued to grow. The top categories of our SME business include app downloads, O2O companies and e-commerce. Nevertheless, the recent macro and regulatory headwinds have slowed growth in several sectors, particularly the gaming sector, which was considered as one of our top industries of SME ad business with outstanding results from some of our top industries during the quarter, including online education, entertainment and others.Revenue of $28.5 million from Alibaba contributed 6% of our net revenue, up 13% or an increase of 16% on a constant currency basis. Revenue from Alibaba is highly correlated with its marketing campaign and initiatives spending, which can fluctuate significantly in any given quarter. Weibo also has a unique position in Alibaba's ecosystem. We not only provide marketing channel for Alibaba's core e-commerce business, but we're also integrated into Alibaba's O2O payment solutions, products, and video integration, entertainment and video businesses. Value-added service, VAS, revenue was $15.9 million in third quarter, up 18% or an increase of 20% on a constant currency basis. Game services declined year-over-year, and it now makes up only 6% of our VAS revenues. Membership fees, which include individual memberships, enterprise account verification, and V-plus membership, were up 45%.Turning to cost and expenses, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $272.2 million, up 45% or 43% under the old basis. Excluding the related barter transactions, marketing expenses were $108.9 million under the old basis. The increase in expense was primarily due to the increase in sales and the marketing fees, as well as product development costs. We continue to taking a more focused approach to increase user acquisition and retention, as well as expand user engagement over multiple channels. As such, the non-GAAP sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue was 24% during the third quarter under the old basis, up 1% from the same period last year, and it's mainly due to the increase in channel marketing spending and the investments relating to the promotion of Weibo Lite. The increase in product development expenditure was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel-related cost.Non-GAAP operating income was 188 million in third quarter, up 42% representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 41%. Income tax expense was $37.9 million compared to $22 million last year. The increase was primarily due to the deferred tax liabilities recognized from the fair value changes of investments and higher profitability. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Weibo in the third quarter was $171.8 million or up 49%.Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow items, as of September 30, 2018, Weibo's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $1.6 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was $122.1 million. Capital expenditures totaled $6 million, while depreciation and amortization expenses amounted to $4.5 million. As a leading social media platform in China, Weibo's scale and brand strength have allowed us to grow the platform efficiently. As a result, we delivered free cash flow of 116.1 million (ph) in third quarter.According to our ADR Depositary Form, as of September 30, 2018, approximately 28% of Weibo's share outstanding were represented by ADR shares, 86% of which were considered floating shares. Regarding the acquisition of Yi's live broadcasting business, as Gaofei mentioned in his remarks, the combination of Yi's live broadcasting business with Weibo will further enrich our content ecosystem, offer better support to top content creators, and improve our monetization capability and efficiency. We plan to complete the acquisition process in fourth quarter.Now let me turn to our financial outlook. We anticipate our first quarter of 2018 revenue to be in the range of $480 million and $490 million, which assumes a foreign exchange rate of RMB7 to $1, or an increase of 35% to 38% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This forecast lacks the potential impact of matters and regulatory uncertainties as well as currency translation headwinds.With that, let me now turn the floor over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Juan Lin, 86Research. Please ask your question.Juan Lin -- 86Research -- AnalystThank you, management. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on your Q4 guidance. I notice that the Q4 guidance shows a slowdown compared to the third quarter in terms of growth, I'm wondering whether the guidance is mainly due to the regulatory environment change and also the macro impact on certain categories that you have already noticed or whether you have noticed some more for the impact from the macro environment change and how should we look at 2019? The second question is on your margins. I notice that non-GAAP operating margin actually improved versus last quarter, especially sales and marketing expenses seem to be well controlled. So I wonder what is future investment plan for user acquisition and how should we look at margins going forward? Thank you.Gaofei Wang -- Chief Executive Officer(Foreign Language) I think I addressed somewhat just this issue in my prepared remarks. From -- as I indicated in my script, there's two main elements that are affecting our growth rate in the fourth quarter as you have -- we indicated that our growth rate in the fourth quarter will be slower compared to the third quarter. The first element will be the macro situation, and particular for those items with big dollar ticket size in the -- we're looking at industry segments such as auto segment with the travel and like big ticket item such as wedding services. And the other element we -- I addressed on the call is the gaming industry. I think you are very much aware of the regulatory challenges most companies are facing these days and that has had an impact on the marketing dollars spent on that particular industry. That impact was larger than the initial estimates we had made at the beginning of the year. As a result, that could impact our growth rate in the fourth quarter.(Foreign Language) What I have indicated earlier, these we will consider external factors. There will be few like company-specific factors for you to consider. One, as I indicated in my remarks, during the tough period of the macroeconomic situation, we are doing -- we are actually expanding our investments in the gaming verticals. We believe that right now it's a good time to acquire users, Weibo users at a much more reasonable cost. That's one factor, even though this is not too much related to the revenue growth. The other thing which I also indicated on my script is we have significantly increased our investments in those MCN multi-channel network agencies who are actively -- who are being very active with Weibo. We are providing our operating inventory for them to subsidize their content creation as well as to help them to monetize. The new subsidy we have been providing to them would effectively reduce their native app's demand on our platform. However, we believe these would be a short-term impact. Our history or our past experience have been telling us that, these things, once the overall economic situation improves, those entities tend to return to their normal spending levels. This is the first question.The second, on the margin expansion question, I think we've been very much -- been very disciplined in terms of our spending throughout the years. I don't think that has been a particular issue for the third quarter. If you look back to the past few quarters, as we indicated at the beginning of the year, we have been expecting our margins for the year be relative stable on a year-over-year basis. As a result, our sales growth -- our sales and marketing on absolute dollar as a percentage of revenue has been a relative stable basis. So we do not have any particular reduction in sales marketing or cutback of sales marketing per se. So these are our plans. I think most of our sales and marketing expenditures were planned ahead from a quarter perspective. So hopefully that answers that question.From a forward-looking point of view, I think excluding the impact from Yizhibo which is a bit of a different from margin compensation point of view from our normal business, I think our core business will continue to bear margin that's similar to the level with last year.Juan Lin -- 86Research -- AnalystThank you very much. That's very helpful.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ding Binbin from JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Moving on to the next question from Karen Chan, Jefferies. Please ask your question.Karen Chan -- Jefferies -- AnalystThank you, management, for taking my question. So my first question is, just wondering what's the general thoughts on China's social ad market growth going into 2019, and how should we think about Weibo's growth profile versus industry as peers like Tencent, they start adding more ad inventories? My second question is, any color management can provide on each Yizhibo current monthly grossing level or how much of a revenue contribution should we be expecting starting first quarter 2019 as a result of consolidation? That would be very helpful. Thank you.Gaofei Wang -- Chief Executive Officer(Foreign Language) I would divide the question into, I guess, two parts, to address your question on the social ads outlook for 2019. Starting with the brand ads, I think we look at the competitive landscape in the social ads for brand advertisers, there are limited competitors in the marketplace and our primary competitors in this area is WeChat.(Foreign Language) From demand of brand advertiser in terms they execute a campaign at Weibo, they are not simply looking at the traffic we are providing. They are more concerned about their brand influence, brand awareness, their influence, also the participation of our KOL in their distribution and amplify their brand impact. As a result, we have seen continued growth of our ARPA from our brand advertisers. And on top of that, we are further expanding our customer bases, where we're looking into further going to at a local brand advertiser level in 2019.(Foreign Language) For a brand, the growth of our brand advertisers, I think that the primary pressure is not from the competition we had with WeChat. More so, it's from the market acceptance, meaning that we can acquire more marketers to our brand advertisers who are willing to accept our social ad products and to understand and utilize our social marketing efforts.(Foreign Language) On the other side, let's move onto SME side. Overall, we believe for 2019, SME growth will be a bit of a challenging. There's twofold. One is with the current macro condition, the overall demand is decreasing and on the other side, we're looking at increasing supply in traffic in the market.(Foreign Language) In the past few years, our growth of SME has largely depending on the growth on our traffic and we have been paid a little bit less attention in terms of our product with the social marketing features. With 2019, I think we're going to shift some of the focus into this area.(Foreign Language) I think we recognized this could be challenging. However, with these social platforms such as Weibo and WeChat, other than providing traffic for purchase conversion, we do have advantages in terms of interaction between merchant and their fans or merchants and their followers compared to other pure media platforms. Of course, in the midst of that, we still need to have -- we have to pay efforts in terms of the ecosystem to support the growth at SMEs, that including our distributors.(Foreign Language) In terms of the Yi live broadcasting, we just take over -- just took over the Yi live broadcasting team in the month of October. For the first two quarters, we believe our focus will be on the product side, particular the product features with Yi live broadcasting with few -- with our Weibo platform that need to be well interfaced. As a result, we have had no specific revenue forecast for 2019 on live broadcasting yet.(Foreign Language) Just to give you supplemental comments on the live broadcasting, I'm sure a lot of you are aware of that. The live broadcasting industry have been quite impacted by the popularity of short video in 2018. In the past the Yi live broadcasting have been focusing on the live broadcasting of showcase and KOLs. Rather, this is not an area that Weibo has significant competitive advantage compared to others. We plan to, for the first few quarters, spend more time to develop on the selected verticals or celebrity live broadcasting with Yizhibo, so that these two platforms can have better converging efforts.Thank you.Karen Chan -- Jefferies -- AnalystVery much -- very helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ding Binbin from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.Binbin Ding -- JPMorgan -- AnalystHi, good evening, management. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on strong third quarter results. My first question is on your short video strategy. So can you elaborate the progress on execution of the short video strategy so far? What is the current revenue and traffic contribution from short video in the third quarter? In terms of monetization, is there any particular sectors factored into focus at the initial stage? And also what kind of impact will short video monetization bring to our existing KA and SME advertising revenue? My second question is, quickly -- so between the live streaming and short video content, how do you prioritize your focus on the investment in these two type of content formats? And lastly, I would like to quickly ask if there any new initiatives that we expect from your partnership with Alibaba in the next year? Thank you.Gaofei Wang -- Chief Executive Officer(Foreign Language) I think, most of you aware that in the last two years, the short video has been the primary drivers of our platform growth, both from viewership and from a user growth point of view. However, for the first half of 2018 with the popularity of few short video platforms that has put pressure in terms of user growth rates on the video side.(Foreign Language) In the third quarter, we have made adjustment in terms of user acquisition from video content. So we will be focusing more effort in terms of the content consumption and interactions between the content creators and the users to acquire users. And from the content type and on the content type point of view, we have switched more focusing on the PTC content, and the content with particular IP.(Foreign Language) In terms of advertising demand, rather they try to put more advertising material into the video format. They haven't been strictly associated their video campaign with particular video content on the platform. As a result, you see continued stable growth of our video advertising dollar as a percentage of our total advertising dollar. This quarter has been up 2 percentage points to 27%.(Foreign Language) In terms of your second question, our investment priority in between live broadcasting and short video, no doubt short video will continue the top priority for this platform. We believe short video will be the baseline media format going forward in terms of content creation and content consumption.(Foreign Language) In terms of the volume of the short video and live broadcasting, short video creation on the platform on a daily basis is in the millions, while the live broadcasting might be in the 10,000. So from that volume difference you could see who has been the dominant player. Live broadcasting will be primarily used by our top content creators such as celebrities as a supplemental media format for their content distributions.I think, at this point of time, we have not started our particular negotiation or discussion with 2019 plan with Alibaba. So we have no -- at this point, there's no indicator in terms of the further new programs we'll be working with Ali. Neither, there will be the firm contracting advertising dollars. So we'll be working with Ali for the following years.Binbin Ding -- JPMorgan -- AnalystThank you.OperatorThank you. As there are no more further questions, I'll hand the call to the presenter for closing remarks. Please continue.Wen Li -- Investor Relations ManagerThat concludes today's conference call.

WB,11-27-2018 06:15PM,8 China Stocks With Long-Term Upside,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-china-stocks-long-term-201637064.html,"Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief is delivered every weekday by 6:30 a.m. ET.The recent U.S. stock market rout started in early October. But many months before U.S. stocks started falling off a cliff, China stocks were dropping into correction territory.The rationale behind the selloff in China stocks is pretty straightforward. The China economy has been flashing warning signs of cooling off for several months, while the U.S. dollar has concurrently strengthened. Amid this economic slowdown and U.S. dollar uptick, U.S. and China trade tensions have not improved, and the probability of bigger and more wide-sweeping tariffs coming in 2019 is now quite high. Bigger tariffs could accentuate China’s economic slowdown, and this will inevitably result in slower growth numbers across all of China’s big companies.This is the mindset investors have taken with China stocks over the past several months. It’s quite bearish. But, it isn’t wrong, either. China’s economy is slowing, and tariffs could slow things down even more. As such, the near term outlook for China stocks is fairly bearish.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut while the near-term outlook is bearish, the long-term outlook is bullish.In the big picture, this is still a country with over a billion people, most of whom are rapidly urbanizing and digitizing. GDP growth is still in excess of 6%, while household income and expenditures per capita still remain a fraction of what they are in the U.S. Long term, the consumer landscape of China will increasingly look like the consumer landscape in America, implying that big growth is here to stay for the next several years. As this urbanization narrative matures over the next several years, China stocks should bounce back.With that in mind, here’s a list of eight China stocks with exposure to all of China’s most promising growth themes, making these stocks the most likely to rally in a big way once near term risks pass.Source: ShutterstockAt the top of this list is China’s most well-known and biggest tech company, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).For all intents and purposes, Alibaba is the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China. They have a huge and rapidly growing e-commerce business. They also have a huge and rapidly growing cloud business. There is also a big-growth digital advertising business, a rapidly expanding offline retail business and a still-developing AI businesses. All together, both companies have consistently exhibited 20%-plus revenue growth.There’s just three big differences between the fundamentals of Amazon and the fundamentals of Alibaba. One, Alibaba is far more profitable. Alibaba’s operating margins are around 20%. Amazon’s are near 5%. Two, Alibaba is growing way faster. Alibaba’s revenue growth was in excess of 50% last quarter. Amazon’s was below 30%. Three, Alibaba stock is way cheaper. Alibaba stock trades at under 30X forward earnings. Amazon stock trades at 80X forward earnings.The big reason Alibaba stock is way cheaper has two parts. First, Alibaba is cheaper because of near-term headline risks inherent to the Chinese economy — but eventually, these headline risks will pass. Second, Alibaba is cheaper because margins are compressing, not expanding. Margin compression is a temporary phenomena sparked by big growth-related investments that will pass with time.As such, the headwinds keeping Alibaba stock are short-sighted in nature, while the tailwinds are long-running. This makes Alibaba stock a likely candidate for a big bounce once U.S. and China trade relations improve.Source:  Daniel Cukier via FlickrSecond on this list is Alibaba’s competitor and China’s second biggest e-retailer, JD (NASDAQ:JD).Much like Alibaba, JD is a hyper-growth tech giant powered by a rapidly growing e-commerce business. Also much like Alibaba, the big problem with JD is slowing revenue growth and margin compression against the backdrop of a Chinese economy that is rapidly cooling. Last quarter’s 25% revenue growth rate pales in comparison to the year ago quarter’s 40% growth rate, while operating margins are down 90 basis points year-to-date to a measly 0.5%.Until revenue growth or margin expansion trends turn around, JD stock won’t rebound.Fortunately, they should be able to turn around. Slower growth recently is a reflection of economic uncertainty in China due to strained trade relations. Eventually, those trade relations will improve, and when they do, JD’s revenue growth should bounce back. Plus, growth should get a big lift as the company expands internationally into new markets.Moreover, much like at Alibaba, margin compression at JD is a temporary phenomena driven by growth-related investments that will inevitably phase out over time.Thus, in the big picture, JD is just fine. The bull thesis is predicated on valuation. At current levels, JD stock is trading at less than 0.5X trailing sales. That multiple strongly implies continued revenue growth deceleration and continued margin compression. From this perspective, the current valuation on JD gives this China stock ample room to run higher when revenue growth and margin trends reverse course.Source: ShutterstockNext up on this list is the company which many consider to be the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of China, Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).Much like the other stocks on this list, WB stock has dropped due to a combination of slowing growth, trade risks, and margin headwinds. But, also much like other stocks on this list, these headwinds are temporary, while the company’s tailwinds are robust and long running.The long term fundamentals underlying Weibo stock are quite promising. You have a red hot social media company that has 430 million monthly active users and is consistently adding about 20 million new users every quarter. You have revenue growth that was in excess of 60% last quarter. Also, margins are stable year-over-year.This growth isn’t going anywhere any time soon. Weibo has generated just $1.5 billion in trailing twelve month revenues on 430 million users. Its U.S. comp, Twitter, has generated nearly twice as much on 100 million fewer users. When all is said and done and the China and U.S. digital ad landscapes are both mature, there is no reason why Wiebo’s users should generate less revenue than Twitter’s users. Thus, Weibo has a tremendous runway ahead to scale ARPU to Twitter levels.This robust unit growth potential on top of consistent user growth will power continued 20%-plus revenue growth for many years to come. Meanwhile, margins should at worst remain stable, and more realistically grow with robust revenue growth. That implies something to the tune of 20% to 30% earnings growth over the next several years.WB stock trades at just 18X forward earnings. Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) trades at a slightly higher multiple. That makes no sense.Source: ShutterstockAnother China stock with hulking long-term upside is live streaming and social media company Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO).Momo is a really good company doing innovative things in a really good space. Momo’s business most closely resembles Tinder, as the platform is designed to be a couples and friends match-making service. This is a good space to be in. It runs parallel to the whole social media growth narrative playing out in China, but also evades competition because it is niche and designed for a purpose unmet by other Chinese social platforms.But, Momo is much more than just China’s Tinder. The company is a leader in China’s booming live-streaming market. To be sure, growth in this market is decelerating and the Chinese government is starting to step in and crack down. But mobile phone penetration and usage is only going up from here, and with it goes mobile video consumption and live-streaming. As Elijah Whaley, CMO of ParkLu, which manages Chinese live-streaming stars, observed: “Mass programming cannot satisfy niche interests.”Overall, the growth narrative at Momo is not broken. Recent numbers affirm this. Q2 was a clean double-beat-and-raise quarter for Momo that comprised nearly 60% revenue growth and 90% profit growth.Like many China stocks, the bull thesis on MOMO stock is predicated on valuation. Despite continued strong numbers, Momo has sold off in sympathy with other China stocks. Consequently, MOMO stock now trades at just 13X forward earnings. That multiple makes no sense next to 90% profit growth last quarter, nor next to the company’s strong growth fundamentals in China’s still rapidly growing digital economy. As such, once near-term headline risks pass, MOMO stock could bounce back in a big way.Source: Thomas Galvez via FlickrA list of China stocks with long-term upside would be incomplete without including China’s go-to online travel site, Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP).Often referred to as the Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) of China, Ctrip was a big winner for the better part of the past decade thanks to a boom in China air travel. As China consumers have urbanized and earned more, they have naturally wanted to travel more and spend those new dollars seeing the world. As such, the narrative at Ctrip has been one characterized by robust and consistent top and bottom line growth.This narrative is slowing now. Last quarter, revenue growth was just 20%. In the year ago quarter, it was over 40%. Moreover, revenue growth next quarter is expected to be below 20%. This slowdown can be attributed to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty in China, and will persist so long as such uncertainty remains.But, that uncertainty won’t remain forever, and the long-term fundamentals here are really good. Just 7% of Chinese citizens have a passport. That is really low. In America, that figure stands closer to 40%. Moreover, Chinese tourists made just 145 million overseas visits last year, which equates to just 10% of the total population. Because of this, the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute (COTRI) predicts that overseas trips will grow from 145 million last year, to over 400 million by 2030.Naturally, as this growth narrative plays out, CTRP stock will be a big winner. As such, once near-term headline risks pass, CTRP stock should grow alongside a still burgeoning China air travel growth narrative.Source: ShutterstockChinese digital search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has not been spared in the recent China stock market rout. The stock peaked in May 2018 at over $280. Since then, BIDU has dropped more than 35% to $180.Much like the other stocks on this list, Baidu has been hampered by a combination of headwinds. Revenue growth is slowing. Margins are under pressure. Forward growth estimates are coming down. Analysts are growing increasingly pessimistic.But, beyond the noise, the long term fundamentals supporting Baidu stock are still pretty strong. Baidu is China’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and as China’s Google, Baidu provides the backbone for China’s internet. Beyond that, Baidu has high-growth cloud, IoT, and AI businesses, the sum of which are still in the early stages of a multiyear growth narrative.All together, so long as internet usage continues to rise in China and enterprise investment into things like cloud and AI continues to grow, Baidu’s growth fundamentals should remain strong. That is a promising read. But, the big concern here is margin compression (operating margins were down 500 basis points last quarter). Until those margins reverse course, BIDU stock won’t bounce back.Margins should bounce back in the medium to long term. Over the next several years, digital advertising, AI, IoT and cloud growth will likely power 15%-20% revenue growth at Baidu. During that stretch, it will be tough for expenses to keep up with revenue. Right now, Baidu is being weighed by huge losses at iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) and big investments into the app ecosystem. Eventually, iQiyi’s margins will improve with scale, and big investments into apps will scale back once the app ecosystem is fully fleshed out. When that happens, these big expenses dragging margins down will phase out, and margins will ramp higher on a much bigger revenue base.Thus, BIDU stock has big bounce back potential at current levels. The stock won’t realize that potential until margins stabilize and/or the trade situation improves. But, these aren’t a matter of “if.” They are a matter of “when.”Source: ShutterstockChinese internet giant Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has had an especially tough 2018. Tencent stock peaked in January 2018 at over $60, and now trades below $40.The big problem here is revenue deceleration. Margins are compressing, but they’ve been compressing for the past several years. In early 2015, TCEHY had 60%-plus gross margins and 40%-plus operating margins. Big investments and a shift to lower-margin revenue streams have dragged margins way down since then. Today, Tencent has 47% gross margins and 30% operating margins, and both of those metrics are rapidly dropping.But, margin compression wasn’t a big problem for Tencent from 2015 to 2017 because revenue growth was big enough to offset margin compression. That is no longer the case. Last quarter, revenue growth decelerated meaningfully. That deceleration negatively impacted the company’s bottom line, as its operating profits actually dropped year-over-year.Therefore, unless Tencent’s revenue growth re-accelerates or its margin declines moderate, the outlook for Tencent’s profit growth isn’t all the great. At this point, with the Chinese economy slowing, no positive progress on U.S.-China trade talks, and Tencent’s top- and bottom-line issues, there is little reason to believe TCEHY stock will reach a positive turning point anytime soon.Long term, though, the upside is compelling. This is a company with robust exposure to all things internet in China. Tencent operates China’s largest social media platforms — Weixin and WeChat — and they have more than 1 billion combined active users. The company’s other social media and communication apps — QQ and Qzone — aren’t small either. They both have 500 million-plus monthly active users. Beyond social, Tencent is also the gaming giant in China, and it’s the top online games maker by revenue in the world. TCEHY also owns China’s biggest digital video, news, music, and literature platforms. As if that weren’t enough, Tencent also operates China’s largest mobile payment platform and its largest mobile security network.In other words, TCEHY not only has exposure to all things internet in China, it actually dominates all things internet in China. Thus, as goes the outlook for the growth of internet services in China, so goes Tencent. Considering that demand for internet services is expected to continue growing rapidly in China, Tencent stock is still supported by a favorable multiyear growth outlook.As a result, in the big picture, the near-term weakness of TCEHY stock price is a long-term buying opportunity. But, investors will want to wait for revenue growth turn the corner and/or margin declines to moderate before buying the dip.Source: ShutterstockThe riskiest yet potentially most rewarding stock on this list is Huya (NASDAQ:HUYA).Huya is China’s leading video streaming platform, and that inherently implies huge speculative long-term growth potential for this stock. Across the globe, live streaming video game viewership numbers are skyrocketing, and everyone from Amazon to Google to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is investing big into this market.But the biggest growth is happening China, where Huya reigns supreme. China is the world’s largest games market in terms of revenue and gamers. In 2017, gaming revenues were $32.2 billion in China, versus $26.4 billion the U.S. The disparity is mostly driven by the fact that China has 646 million gamers, essentially double the entire U.S. population.And this disparity is expected to only widen. Over the next five years, an expansion in China’s gamer base from 646 million to 917 million is expected to drive 13% compounded annual growth in gaming revenues. Meanwhile, in the U.S., gaming revenues are expected to grow at a mere 5% clip over the next five years.Clearly, China is the big growth story here. And when it comes to China video game live streaming, Huya is king with almost 50% market share (83 million monthly active users last year versus China gaming monthly users of 180 million).Consequently, as the China eSports and live streaming markets explode higher over the next several years, Huya stock should climb higher, too. But, this bull thesis isn’t without risk. Recent weak quarterly numbers imply market share erosion and slowing growth. If these trends persist, Huya stock will be stuck in its current downtrend.As such, the long-term growth narrative on Huya stock is promising. But, there are near term risks which should investors on the sidelines for the near term.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA, AMZN, WB, BIDU, GOOG, and FB.Compare BrokersThe post 8 China Stocks With Long-Term Upside appeared first on InvestorPlace."

Ma is China’s richest man with a fortune of $35.8 billion, according to Forbes.It was unclear why the paper chose to mention Ma’s affiliation now but it comes amid a push by Beijing to bring the country’s private enterprises more in line with Party values, especially in the technology sector that has grown rapidly, driven by the successes of private firms.Ma, who announced in September he would step down as Alibaba chairman next year, is China’s highest-profile business leader. He has acted as an adviser to political leaders in Asia and Europe and fostered big ambitions in the United States.He has driven Alibaba to become a $390 billion giant, which dominates China’s online retail market, stretches from logistics to social media, and has spawned a separate fintech empire around popular payment platform Alipay.Ma’s political affiliation came as a surprise to many.Results from domestic search engine Baidu Inc, when asked “is Jack Ma a Communist Party member”, also mostly said that he was not.Alibaba declined to comment on Ma’s Party membership, but said political ties did not impact the firm’s operations.“Political affiliation of any executive does not influence the company’s business decision-making process,” a spokesperson said in emailed comments to Reuters on Tuesday.“We follow all laws and regulations in countries where we operate as we fulfil our mission of making it easier for people to do business anywhere in the digital era.”The People’s Daily list also included Baidu head Robin Li and Tencent Holding Ltd chief Pony Ma, though did not name either of them as Party members.

Mr. Pichai’s scheduled appearance in front of the House Judiciary Committee is another important step to restoring public trust in Google and all the companies that shape the Internet.”McCarthy also said Congress wants to review Google’s potential new investments in China.Google previously told U.S. lawmakers it was considering “a variety of options” to offer additional services in China, but declined to detail plans for addressing Chinese censorship.The company has come under criticism after reports it was considering re-entering China’s search engine market and would comply with its internet censorship and surveillance policies.On Tuesday, more than 200 Google engineers, designers and managers demanded in an open letter that the company end development of a censored search engine for Chinese users, escalating earlier protests against the project.In September, a bipartisan group of 16 U.S. House lawmakers asked Google to disclose precautions it would take to protect the safety of its users if Chinese regulators allow its search engine to operate.Pichai may also face questions about why it delayed disclosing vulnerabilities with its Google+ social network.

The exemption will be expanded in the United States next year, it said.The exemption is a partial reversal to Facebook’s earlier decision to include ads in its Ad Library from news organizations mentioning political figures, elections or issues of national importance.A group of news publishers had written a letter in June to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, protesting the social network’s inclusion of news content in its new policies meant for labeling and archiving all political ads.Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Anil D'Silva"

FB,11/28/2018,U.S. rights groups seek secret documents in Facebook encryption case,https://www.reuters.com//article/us-facebook-encryption/u-s-rights-groups-seek-secret-documents-in-facebook-encryption-case-idUSKCN1NX2IV,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Two civil rights groups asked a judge on Wednesday to release documents describing a secret U.S. government effort to force Facebook Inc to decrypt voice conversations between users on its Messenger app.A joint motion by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in U.S. District Court in Fresno, California argued that the public’s right to know the state of the law on encryption outweighs any reason the U.S. Justice Department might have for protecting a criminal probe or law-enforcement method.The issue arose in a joint federal and state investigation  into activities of the MS-13 gang in Fresno, revolving around the end-to-end encryption Facebook uses to protect calls on its Messenger service from interception. End-to-end encryption means that only the two parties in the conversation have access to it.Neither U.S. prosecutors nor Facebook have commented publicly about the Messenger case because of a court gag order. But Reuters reported in September that investigators failed in a courtroom effort to force Facebook to wiretap Messenger voice calls.The motion said that although it is possible that other courts have faced similar issues in secret, the Fresno court in the Eastern District of California may be the first “to rule on whether the federal government can force a private social media company to undermine its own security architecture to aid a criminal investigation.”“The functioning of our common-law system depends on courts making their opinions publicly accessible, so that litigants and judges may rely on each other’s reasoning,” the motion said.It sought the release of the government’s arguments and any ruling accepting or rejecting each of those arguments. It said the court could redact information about people that could hurt a criminal case.To stress the importance of the encryption issue being aired, the rights groups compared the Facebook legal fight to a dispute in 2016. In that year, the FBI asked courts to force Apple to break into an iPhone owned by a slain sympathizer of Islamic State in San Bernardino, California, who had murdered county employees.The Apple case also began in secret. But after it became public, it was central to the national debate about government’s authority over tech companies.End-to-end encryption also protects Facebook’s WhatsApp, Signal’s communications app and other services.U.S. telecommunications companies are required to give police access to calls under federal law, but many apps that rely solely on internet infrastructure are exempt. Facebook contended Messenger was covered by that exemption, sources told Reuters.Public court filings in the Fresno case showed the government was intercepting all ordinary phone calls and Messenger texts between the accused gang members.An FBI affidavit cited three Messenger calls that investigators were unable to hear. The participants in those calls were arrested anyway.One matter judges weigh in approving wiretap requests is how much of a burden it would be for the company to help.

FB,11/28/2018,US civil rights groups seek secret documents in Facebook encryption fight,https://www.reuters.com//article/facebook-encryption/us-civil-rights-groups-seek-secret-documents-in-facebook-encryption-fight-idUSL2N1Y31J0,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Two civil rights groups asked a judge on Wednesday to release documents describing a secret U.S. government effort to force Facebook Inc to decrypt voice conversations between users on its Messenger app.A joint motion by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in U.S. District Court in Fresno, California argued that the public’s right to know the state of the law on encryption outweighs any reason the U.S. Justice Department might have for protecting a criminal probe or law-enforcement method.The issue arose in a joint federal and state investigation  into activities of the MS-13 gang in Fresno, revolving around the end-to-end encryption Facebook uses to protect calls on its Messenger service from interception. End-to-end encryption means that only the two parties in the conversation have access to it.Neither U.S. prosecutors nor Facebook have commented publicly about the Messenger case because of a court gag order. But Reuters reported in September that investigators failed in a courtroom effort to force Facebook to wiretap Messenger voice calls.The motion said that although it is possible that other courts have faced similar issues in secret, the Fresno court in the Eastern District of California may be the first “to rule on whether the federal government can force a private social media company to undermine its own security architecture to aid a criminal investigation.”“The functioning of our common-law system depends on courts making their opinions publicly accessible, so that litigants and judges may rely on each other’s reasoning,” the motion said.It sought the release of the government’s arguments and any ruling accepting or rejecting each of those arguments. It said the court could redact information about people that could hurt a criminal case.To stress the importance of the encryption issue being aired, the rights groups compared the Facebook legal fight to a dispute in 2016. In that year, the FBI asked courts to force Apple to break into an iPhone owned by a slain sympathizer of Islamic State in San Bernardino, California, who had murdered county employees.The Apple case also began in secret. But after it became public, it was central to the national debate about government’s authority over tech companies.End-to-end encryption also protects Facebook’s WhatsApp, Signal’s communications app and other services.U.S. telecommunications companies are required to give police access to calls under federal law, but many apps that rely solely on internet infrastructure are exempt. Facebook contended Messenger was covered by that exemption, sources told Reuters.Public court filings in the Fresno case showed the government was intercepting all ordinary phone calls and Messenger texts between the accused gang members.An FBI affidavit cited three Messenger calls that investigators were unable to hear. The participants in those calls were arrested anyway.One matter judges weigh in approving wiretap requests is how much of a burden it would be for the company to help.

We are going to keep doing all we can to be a truly inclusive company,” the spokesman said.In a detailed Facebook post, Luckie said he saw Facebook moderators remove potentially offensive posts by black users, while the same posts by white people were left up despite user complaints.He also said he experienced discrimination in the office, as coworkers sometimes clutched their wallets when he walked by, a reactionary behavior he attributed to the color of his skin.Racial discrimination at the company “is real,” Luckie said.He added black employees who turn to the company’s HR for resolutions are made to believe such “disheartening patterns are a figment of our imagination.”Shares of Facebook have had a rocky year, under pressure from revelations about privacy and operational issues as well as concerns over slowing revenue growth.Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila"

The fact that they knew she had complained and agreed to a confidential settlement with Microsoft was enough to make out a retaliation claim under state law, the court said.To read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/2RvUxRd"
